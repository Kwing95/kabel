# Diego stirs behind them.

Diego: How far's the black market from the station?

Asra: Not too far. Probably ten minutes or so on the trolley.

Diego: You haven't been here in years. You sure it's in the same spot?

Asra: It's run by the officers. Unless someone picked up the whole barracks and
put it down somewhere else I doubt it’s gone anywhere. Also...

# Asra points to a massive port in the distance.

Asra: That's where we want to go once we've got uniforms. Since the United
Territories of Debony is the only trade partner as far north we are, ships
commuting anywhere else should have tropical barnacles stuck to them.

Thane: And we're sure we want to go to Debony?

Diego: Distance is the key factor here. Every country in Kabel is trying to get
their hands on Cheminan engineers. We can expect political asylum pretty much
anywhere. What’s important is we make it to land before we’re discovered.

# The train begins slowing down. Thane points to a transit center milling with
# a large crowd. Snow begins to fall.

Thane: So can we transfer there?

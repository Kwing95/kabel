SCRIPT EXECUTION ORDER
 - MazeMaker: Must run before Grapher because it modifies the map
 - Grapher: Must run after MazeMaker so that it can graph an up-to-date map
 - PlayerMover: Must run before other scripts that need reference to PlayerMover.instance
 - GridMover: Must Awake to initialize "rotator"
 - Health: 

DEBUGGING
 - Enemies walk through walls when the direction argument of ChangeDirection is not a cardinal. This happens
    when their current position is not adjacent to the path
 - Some enemies may start without trying to pathfind to a point on their route
 - In Navigator before calling GridMover.ChangeDirection, check that position equals path[pathProgress - 1]
   so you don't go off route (and into walls)
 - [Seed 3, enemyCount 1] Navigator path contains same position twice; direction will be 0,0
 - [Seed 4, enemyCount 3] 

 - Enemy routes may go through walls (Globals should initialize afterward? Race condition?)

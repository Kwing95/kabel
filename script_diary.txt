Vanna/Thane backstory ==========================================================

Thane: Hey. How are you holding up?

Asra: Now that Vanna's dead, it feel... different. Seeing her dead made me think
about how every person has their own history, you know? Like I already knew that
but it feels so much more real now.

Dagan: You said you had a lot of history with Vanna, right?

Asra:

 Vanna's parents weren't around when she was growing up, so she had to grow
up fast and take care of business. She also had a little sister, Seraphim. All
Seraphim wanted to do was help people. When the Civil War broke out, she treated
people on both sides, even though Vanna begged her to stay away from the
frontlines. One day when she was tending to a bunch of wounded soldiers,
Somoza's men gunned down the entire medical tent. Whatever softness she might
have had was gone the day her Seraphim died. Now that I think back, Vanna
kind of treated me like a little sister. Like she wanted me to grow up to be
tougher than Seraphim was, and not to risk myself for others.

[Dagan sighs, then lays down. Once he starts snoring, Thane speaks.]

Thane: I think Dagan's the same way. He and Mom were really close. Too close,
now that I look back on it as an adult. I remember as a kid thinking he always
kind of strict, but when Mom was taken away something changed. I was actually
afraid of him for several years. Which is weird to say, because he was never
angry or violent around me, but I could tell something was off. Actually... My
mom wanted Dad to turn her in. She said it was only a matter of time before they
took her anyway, but if he was the one that did it, the goverment would trust
that he was raising me right.

UNKNOWN DATE ===================================================================
NENEGI CORRECTIONS FACILITY GOALS ==============================================

POSSIBILITIES

* Peleg can introduce information about Erawa, or Nenegi Corrections Facility,
including treatment of prisoners there
* Peleg introduces the audience to what an extremely strong evincer can do under
extreme circumstances (training, experimentation, sensory deprivation)
* The audience may learn more about Dagan's relationship with Phaedra
* Peleg may have some involvement in how Thane and Dagan escape to Tripsi

OBSERVATIONS

* Peleg is not present long enough for a really deep personality to emerge; a
strong personality will still be interesting
* For Peleg to be an interesting character, the reader must know something about
  him. The reader won't know unless he shares; he won't share unless there is
  common ground between him and others.
  
INVARIANTS

* Peleg is bilingual and is versed in Cheminan culture

  - The reader will not know anything about him unless he shares information.
  - The character will not share information unless there is common ground.
    * Peleg speaks both Cheminan and Erawan
	* Peleg is middle-aged and spent time in Chemina in his youth
	  - If he's from Gheni, he talks with Thane; if Chalt, he talks with Dagan
	  - Peleg studied at University of Gheni before Civil War and knows area?
	  - Peleg is a career military that worked in the Erawan Department of
	    Foreign relations. Prior to the Cheminan-Erawan conflict, he studied
		history at University of Gheni and was interested in signing trade deals
		with Chemina, causing him to lose favor among his peers. He was
		subsequently forced to serve as infantry in the Cheminan-Erawan War,
		leading to his capture and detainment in Nenegi Corrections Facility.
  - This section should not just be an information dump; a character arc must
    exist. Peleg may get closure on the squadmate he's looking for, perhaps they
	encounter other Erawan soldiers storming the prison. This can introduce
	conflicts and decisions to make the setting of this scene relevant.
  - Peleg wants to raid an unguarded supply of Pronsi, a drug whose withdrawal
    symptoms cause death, used to keep prisoners under control.
  - Does Peleg have to be a soldier? Yes, no other explanation for him being a
    prisoner. Unless he's been imprisoned since Civil War - Cheminan citizen?
  - Does Peleg's friend have to be a soldier? Could be fellow prisoner that
    helped him.

* How might Thane be forced to go to Tripsi?
  - Peleg has a friend that carries Thane there unconscious
  - Thane ends up in some vehicle moving of its own accord
  - There's a border wall between Nenegi and Tripsi?
    - 
  - The Erawan attack involves pinching space to shorten the distance between
    Nenegi and Tripsi
	
JUNE 21 ========================================================================
REGA MENTAL BREAKDOWN ==========================================================

- Thane shoots homeless man in sewers?

Asra: This is all your fucking fault!

Thane: How? How is any of this my fault?

Asra: If you hadn't shot that officer in the trainyard, we would have made it to
Nenegi that same night! No one outside of Gheni would have known who we were,
and Vanna would have helped us!

JUNE 23 ========================================================================
ASRA BACKGROUND ================================================================

Can add some at start of Cargo Inspection
Introduce some arguments in which Asra knows more than Dagan

JUNE 24 ========================================================================

If Thane's transformation is faster and more obvious, is Peleg needed? Basically
only there for fanservice. Does Peleg need to be mentally unhinged? How?

JUNE 27 ========================================================================

Peleg can have PTSD flashback causing a series of hallucinations ending with
Dagan dying. Perhaps he was tortured with electricity and Peleg's flashback
recreates the scene.

Asra may have more humanistic view of Somoza supporters due to her parents;
perhaps they had other redeeming qualities.

On developing Asra: Dagan's views are "too perfect," introduce some fallacies as
well as some ignorance that Asra has particular knowledge about. Her perspective
can tell the audience who she is.

Asra: You turned me into a killer!

JUNE 28 =======================================================================

* WHy is Peleg so strong?
* Why is Peleg avoiding Erawans?

JUlY 2 ========================================================================

Tripsi chapter is missing a main conflict or function, whith the other chapters
have:

1 - Introduces conflict, setting, and tone
2 - Introduces main cast and premise; they embark
3 - Main cast narrowly escapes; goes from fugitives to domestic terrorists
4 - Vanna betrays group, Asra is captured
5 - Thane attempts rescue; Dagan dies
6 - Tripsi
7 - Thane's delusions become more prevalent
8 - Thane is revealed to be hallucinating; ending

TRIPSI...
* Thane's delusions may play a key role
* A persistent group of Erawans hunting Thane may be a plot point
* Oda may play a larger role

What Oda might do to calm down Thane:

Here are ways to help the person who is paranoid:

Don't argue. Ask questions about the person's fears, and talk to the person about the paranoia if the person wants to listen to you. If someone is threatening you, you should call for help.
Use simple directions, if needed. Tell the person that no harm will come to him or her and that you can help. For example, "Sit down, and let's talk about it."
Give the person enough personal space so that he or she does not feel trapped or surrounded. Stay with the person but at a distance that is comfortable for him or her and you. Stay more than an arm's reach away.
Call for help if you think anyone is in danger.
Move the person away from the cause of the fear or from noise and activity, if possible. Ask the person to tell you what is causing the fear. Make a direct statement that you are not afraid.
Focus the person on what is real.
Tell the person everything you are going to do before you do it. For example, "I'm going take out my cell phone."
To help with situations that may cause paranoia:

Help the person avoid things he or she fears. For example, if the person is afraid of dogs, avoid them.
Keep lights turned on if the person tells you that this makes him or her less scared.
Talk about the person's fears when he or she is not paranoid, and make a plan for handling the fears when they occur.
Help the person make a list of his or her fears. At the end, consider asking the person to write, "These things are not going to hurt me. These fears are symptoms of my illness. They will go away if I seek help." Don't insist that the person does this. Doing so may make the person include you as part of the paranoid belief.

JULY 3 =========================================================================

Tripsi possibilities:
* Thane passes through an entire village and is almost killed by an angry mob.
  He struggles with trying not to kill them.
* Tripsi is a slum that many Erawans are exiled to; perhaps there are two tribes
  of Erawans; occupants of Tripsi are considered second class citizens.
  
Oda explains Tripsi to Thane. The Lucinde tribe is more moderate and progressive
but lives around the outer ring of Erawa and are treated like second-class
citizens.

Thane encounters Lucinde Mafia using stolen Cheminan weapons, who attempt to
kill Thane for his rifle.

Igrid - Populate the high-ranking clerics and government officials; mostly 
Lucinde - Moderates oppressed by the Igrid

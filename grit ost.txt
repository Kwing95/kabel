Each player has 3 health bars corresponding to
HEAD, BODY, and LIMBS. Having these drop below
2/3 or 1/3 causes negative status ailments.

      34-66%    0-33%

  (chance of action being canceled)
BODY  150% dmg  200% dmg
  (defense down)
LIMB  2 TURNS   3 TURNS
  (multiple turns required per action)

Bandages restores gauge from 66-99% to 100%
First Aid Kit restores gauge from 1-65% by 33%
Unit is killed when two gauges reach 0%

Medics restore 50% when using First Aid Kit.
Debilitated status (tear gas) = Defense down, unable to act
Blinded (smoke grenade) = Accuracy down

Dead units drop equipment based on which gauge still has
health. Condition of equipment is based on the percentage
of the gauge. Durability decreases with use. Not all units
have all gear.

i-TROOPS use nerve gases on Bane and imaginary
players.

All enemy attacks are prefaced with a random two
letter morse code sequence. Inputting these
letters in reverse allows the player to counterattack
with the targeted player immediately after.

All controls can be accessed via morse code. However, the game may also
be played with traditional menu options as well.

ctd...

Each enemy drops a dog tag including a name, age, and rank,
as well as a photo of their family. These go into the player's
inventory under KILLS and cannot be discarded.

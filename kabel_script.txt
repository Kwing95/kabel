<000> # Panoramic

# An urban city street fades into view. Civilians scatter as a formation
# of troops march forward.

Twenty years ago, the country of Chemina erupted in civil war. Farid Somoza and
his militia emerged victorious and claimed the nation as their own.

# The screen fades to a timelapse of a skyline, with smoke stacks and
# street lights appearing one at a time.

Somoza saw promise in coal and electrical power, creating an economic powerhouse
from the emerging industries.

Soon after, a campaign was launched to occupy the neighboring territory of Erawa
and use its mystic properties as an energy source.

# Evincers are shown driving back Cheminan soldiers with projectile attacks

The Erawan government considered this exploitation impious, expunging the
occupation and thrusting the two nations into protracted conflict.

<001> # The Heat of Battle

# The screen flashes white with a tremendous explosion, after which
# an Erawan village fades into view with several buildings on fire.
# Saito is seen lying on his stomach behind half-destroyed sandbags, while his
# commanding officer watches him from the cover of an abandoned house.

Bane: Move your ass, private!

Saito: Ugh...

# Saito gets up into a crouching position. Bane fires at an evincer, forcing him
# to take cover, and Saito makes a dash to join him behind the house.

Saito: We're getting hammered out here.

Bane: That's what happens when you take the fight to their doorstep.

Saito: So why don't we have ballistic protection for the heat bombs?

# An earth-shaking blast knocks them both to the ground.

Bane: Enough! Let's move!

<002> # Bane's Advice

Bane: Never charge the enemy! Take cover and wait it out until you can get the
drop on them.

Select a tile to move to that position, or select the tile you're already on to
wait a turn instead. Wait on tiles with cover to ambush enemies.

When enemies are on your tile, you may select battle commands to engage them.

<003> # Bane's Death

# A shockwave hurls Bane against a tree, one of its branches impaling him
# through the side. Saito turns to see an Erawan girl duck behind a hut.

Saito: Major, are you...? Oh, no.

# Bane struggles to reach in his pack and pulls out a grenade, which he hands to
# Saito.

Bane: Take it. Flush her out and gun her down.

Saito: Try not to talk. We can-

Bane: No, private. This is beyond mending.

Saito: ...

Bane: Go out there and take down as many as you can.

# Another shockwave comes, throwing Saito to the ground. He looks up to see the
# girl by the hut again, ready to throw a rock. Saito takes off running,
# stopping behind another hut.

Saito: She looks just like Phaedra...

<004> # Infirmary

Saito: Ugh, my head...

# The screen fades from black to show Saito bandaged in a hospital bed.
# A telegraph can be heard off-screen.

???: ... right hand. Third degree burns along arm. Traumatic brain injury.
Multiple fractures.

???: Chance of recovery?

???: Condition stable, full recovery impossible.

???: Fit to fight? Fit to work?

???: Negative to both.

???: We can't spare resources to rehabilitate.

Saito: ... Is this how it all ends? Mauled by a defective grenade and
euthanized in a medical tent? No, they can't be talking about me.

# Footsteps approach and a shadow can be seen through the hospital curtain.

Saito: Well I’m not going down without a fight.

# Saito pretends to be asleep. A nurse comes in and swabs his arm. Before she
# gives an injection, he strikes her in the chest. The screen flashes red, and
# blood gushes from Saito’s hand.

Saito: What happened... to my arm?

# The nurse finishes giving him the injection, after which he collapses.

<100> # Death Letter

# An upstairs bedroom fades into view, showing a young couple sitting together
# on the bed and an older man standing at the window.

Thane: "I regret to inform you that Saito Belikoff was reported killed in action
while deployed in Merad, Erawa. I hope you can find solace in the knowledge of
his heroic service to the state. I extend my deepest sympathy to you."

Asra: ...

Thane: Think it's true?

Asra: That he died on the battlefield? Maybe. Could've been blown up. Could've
been put down. Both happen pretty often.

Diego: It's time to leave. There's nothing left for us here.

Thane: Now?

Asra: There isn’t much for us to wait around for, is there? I’m sure I’ll be
deployed soon.

Thane: That is true. Somoza keeps people on active duty so their families can't
escape without leaving them behind.

Diego: Get the books from the cellar. I don't want them laying around after we
leave.

<100a> # Asra: Diego's Apathy

Asra: How can your uncle care so little about his own brother?

Thane: Diego's lost a lot of family. He doesn't have the energy to grieve
anymore. But you shouldn't take that to mean that he doesn't care.

Asra: And what about you?

Thane: I'm sure he cares about how I'm feeling. He just doesn't know how to show
it.

Asra: No, I mean how are you feeling?

Thane: Er, sad? In shock? I don't know. I think I need some time to process
everything that's going through my head right now. What are you thinking?

Asra: Is it bad if I say I'm really ready to leave this place?

Thane: No. You're in the military reserve. I'm sure you're thinking how easily
that letter could have been about you instead.

Asra: Actually... I was thinking about how both of our parents are gone now. I
just want to go somewhere else and not think about all of this anymore. But I
feel bad pushing your dad under the rug like that.

Thane: I can't expect you to feel the same way about my dad as I do. You barely
knew him. Besides, Diego seems pretty ready to leave, too.

Asra: Heh... Can't believe we finally agree on something.

<100d> # Diego: Traveling Together

Diego: What's the matter? Is the vent stuck?

Thane: No, I haven't been down to the cellar yet.

Diego: I told you to get those books. We need to make sure they're gone before
we get raided.

Thane: I was actually going to ask why you wanted to bring Asra along. I know
you two don't get along.

Diego: Our best bet making it out of the country is through Rega. Asra knows the
city better than we do. She'll be able to help.

Thane: I don't follow your reasoning. There's a difference between living in a
city and knowing how to flee a country from it.

Diego: Asra also knows you're half Erawan. If we left her here she'd be taken
into custody. There's no telling what she'd say. It's best we take her along for
the same reason I want those books gone.

<101> # Book Cellar

# With a click, a lightbulb comes to life, illuminating a small basement. The
# old Cheminan flag hangs sideways on the wall. The screen dims for a flashback.

Thane: The old flag looks kind of creepy.

Saito: I don't see how. The new one has a mountain to represent authority.
That's way worse if you ask me.

# The screen brightens to show Asra behind Thane.

Asra: Hey. Everything alright down here?

Thane: Yeah, what's up?

Asra: You were down here a while. Still bringing this stuff back up?

Thane: It seems like such a waste to burn them.

Asra: Thane... Would you rather be tried as a renegade or traitor? If we get
caught, these are the difference between the gallows and thumbscrews. They have
to go.

Thane: I know. Just... Give me a minute.

<101a> # Asra: About Books

Thane: A Brief History has a tear on one of the pages. Dad wouldn't read me part
of it because he was afraid I'd repeat it in school. I threw a tantrum and tried
to grab it out of his hand.

Asra: How old were you?

Thane: Five.

Asra: That's pretty young to be lecturing your kid about politics.

Thane: He said all the children's books were "nationalistic garbage" so he read
these to me instead. Even though he had to paraphrase most of it. Kind of weird
to think he's not here to protect the book from me this time.

Asra: You shouldn't think of it that way.

Thane: Why not?

Asra: Those books made you who you are. They've served their purpose. We're only
burning them now because we're making room for a new life - one where we can be
safe from Somoza and this stupid war. If Saito could see you now he'd be proud.

Thane: How can you say that? You never even knew him.

Asra: Okay. What would he really think of you?

Thane: I guess... He would have been proud. Probably.

Asra: See? This is the best thing we can do right now. Now come over here and
hold me.

Thane: ... I'm going to miss him.

Asra: I know.

# Thane and Asra embrace tightly.

<102> # Erawa At a Glance

Paranormal phenomena were first observed in Erawa in the sixth century, though
their nature has been closely guarded by the Erawan Empire. Indeed, nearly half
a millennia passed before Zeke Salow observed that the magnitude and frequency

of these events correlated with their proximity to the center of the peninsula.

Legends of Erawan magicians known as evincers had existed for centuries, but it
wasn't until Salow interviewed defected practitioners that he theorized the
center of Erawa contained what he called a 'subjective fracture in objective

reality,' which enabled the temporary suspension of physical law. Evincers
trained to exploit the Fracture, primarily manipulating the natural tundra into
a tropical rainforest suitable for agriculture and resource production, as well

as a source of military power during the period of Cheminan colonization.

Erawa's geography is also a topic of debate. According to mythology, its
distinct shape is a result of ancient evincers causing the land to physically
expand outward from the Fracture itself, resulting in a perfectly round

landmass. However, skeptics argue that such profound influence over the terrain
so far from the center is virtually impossible.

<103> # Beyond Reality: What the Fracture Means for Modern Society

The exact nature of the Fracture is unknown - reality becomes increasingly
unstable as one approaches it. Within a forty-mile radius, objects from an
observer's imagination begin to materialize, and objects not being actively

observed may dematerialize. Beyond a thirty mile radius, unconscious eye
movements cause earthquakes, and measurement tools begin to malfunction.
Experienced evincers are able to dampen these effects, but there are no

confirmed records of the center having been reached.

Because of this, Erawa is divided into five territories shaped like concentric
rings around the center. The ectosphere houses civilians, whose prowess in
evincing is typically modest. The endosphere is home to the aristocracy, who

wield significantly more paranormal power. Beyond this layer is the introsphere,
which requires specific training and discipline to enter safely. As a result,
only devoted evincers and shaman are able to live here. The metasphere lies

beyond this, and while the effects of the Fracture are too potent for this area
to be permanently inhabitable, it is often a staple of an evincer's spiritual
journey. The cryptosphere is the innermost layer, and is the event horizon for

all human activity. Those that cross this boundary are never seen again.

The nature of the center is a topic of fierce debate. Zeke Salow denied that the
itself could have any concrete shape, insisting that complete subversion of
objective reality contradicted the idea of a physical form. He went on to

postulate that a point of purely subjective reality might 'explain the spark of
consciousness that transformed blood-bots into what we call life.'
	
<104> # A Brief History of Cheminan-Erawan Relations

Due to the Erawan Empire's reliance on a natural landmark which proved
ineffective outside of the local territory, the state adopted isolationist
policies, much to the detriment of foreign relations. Erawan-Cheminan diplomacy

only soured in the wake of the Cheminan's industrialization, during which
engineers proposed using the Fracture to construct a perpetual energy machine.
This sparked outrage among Erawan activists who considered technological

exploitation of the Fracture heresy, escalating political tensions to an
all-out war.

Although Chemina has no shortage of trade partners following their emergence as
an economic superpower, the possibility of military intervention by a foreign
body is slim. Developed countries have expressed concerns over Chemina's

political instability and the risk of its supreme leader Farid Somoza using the
Fracture to wage a world war, were it ever secured. Consequently, the two
nations have been locked in a stalemate.

<105> # Erawan Scriptures

Thane: It's in Erawan. The last time anyone could read this was when Mom was
still around.

Asra: I'm really surprised you have one of those.

Thane: Yeah, I'm not sure why we kept it. All of these are banned, but Erawan
literature is by far the biggest liability.

Asra: Where did A Brief History come from? Doesn't it have a lot of contemporary
history?

Thane: A Brief History was published in the United Territories. I'm really not
sure how my dad got a hold of it. I'm sure we'll be able to get another copy if
we make it out of here.

<106> # Old Cheminan Flag

Asra: That thing looks ancient.

Thane: It's not that much older than we are. Probably just looks like it
because we never see them anymore.

Asra: I can't believe your dad fought Somoza's troops back before he rose to
power. Your family's so much more interesting than mine.

# Thane looks down.

Thane: Didn't do them much good, did it? Mom died in the internment camps, and
now Dad's... I'm sorry. It's not like you haven't lost family yourself.

Asra: I'm still grateful, you know. After the Rega Massacre you were all I had
left. There were a lot of people that had nowhere to go. Thanks for taking me
in.

Thane: Asra, I love you. You know I love you. Did you really think I wouldn't
open my doors for you?

Asra: I'm still thankful.

<107> # Book Burning

# Thane holds the books and flag in a fireplace shovel.

Thane: Does anyone want to look at these one last time?

Diego: ...

# Thane thrusts the books into the fire. Diego leaves the room. After a moment
of silence, he walks over to Asra.

Asra: Guess the censors won.

Thane: Weren't you just saying we had to get rid of these?

Asra: Yeah. I can only imagine what Diego's thinking, though. Wasn't he a war
correspondent during the Civil War?

Thane: Kind of. Things got... Weird.

Asra: You mean when he had to pledge his loyalty to Somoza?

Thane: According to my dad, it was actually earlier than that. Even before
Somoza won, Diego wanted to stay neutral. He reported numbers and took photos.

Asra: What about when Phaedra was taken away?

# Thane pauses and looks around.

Thane: By the time Mom was captured, it was clear Somoza was going to win. I
guess Diego wanted to be on the winning side. Even Dad did, although he said it
was only to keep me safe.

Asra: He lost his wife, pledged his loyalty to the man that had her killed, and
after all that Somoza forced him back onto the battlefield. That's so fucked up.

Thane: Asra, I really don't want to think about that right now...

Asra: And now all Diego does is write pro-Somoza propaganda.

Thane: I don't know what to tell you. He's a good writer and it pays the bills.
Neither of us would be here if it weren't for him. That said, a lot of those
books were his. You'd think he'd at least care a little about burning them.

Asra: You said it yourself, didn't you? He did what he had to in order to get
by. We all have feelings but we can't let them get in the way of pragmatism.

<108> # Cheminan Engineering

Diego: It's a shame we can't bring the appliances with us. We won't get this
kind of modern convenience anywhere else in the world.

Thane: That's funny coming from you. Aren't you always talking about how great
the United Territories is?

Diego: Politically, sure. But we've still got a lock on technology. You have to
be pretty rich just to get a refrigerator if you live overseas.

Asra: Don't they live like savages?

Diego: Of course not! They've got all your basic necessities - horse and buggy,
ice boxes, that kind of stuff. Just like when you were a baby.

<> # Past Curfew

Diego: Hey, listen up you two. If things go to shit, you should have these
handy.

# Diego hands Thane a rifle and Asra a revolver.

Asra: Diego, you know I'm a medic, right?

Diego: Doesn't matter. We're not trying to rack up a body count here, but having
some suppressive fire could be a good idea.

Thane: Where did you get these?

Diego: My brother was a bit of a kleptomaniac. When it became apparent Somoza
was winning the war, he started collecting weapons from fallen enemies. Once the
war was over his service weapon was taken but he was able to hide these.

Thane: I'm surprised I didn't know about these before. Why weren't they in the
book cellar?

Diego: Hell if I know. He kept them hidden in the bedroom, of all places.
Fucking maniac.

# Thane unlocks the front door.

Diego: The enemy should never have a chance to retaliate. Ever. Being prepared
means slaughtering thm before they know you're there. Anything short of that is
failure.

Thane: Were people this underhanded during the Civil War?

Diego: "Underhanded" is a pejorative used to make people follow the rules of
some arbitrary leader. Fighting honorably is the same as surrendering to the
side with the biggest guns.

Asra: I thought we weren't trying to kill anyone.

Diego: We're not. Don't treat this like it's a war zone. We should be running
and hiding whenever possible. But if it comes to violence, don't take chances.

<> # I Units

# Thane collapses on the street, vomiting.

Asra: Are you okay?

Thane: Ugh... Damned tear gas...

Asra: What? I didn't-

# Thane vomits more profusely.

Diego: Let's find you some cover so you can take your time getting back up.

# Thane stands up slowly.

Thane: No, I'm okay. Let's keep moving.

<> # Train Hopping

# Diego, Asra, and Thane watch the scenery from the train car. A mix of forest
# and smokestacks pass them.

Asra: I always wanted to take you back home with me, but I never imagined it
like this.

Thane: Yeah. Me too. I wish I'd gotten to know your parents.

# Asra smiles weakly.

Asra: Stop romanticizing it like that, Thane. I already told you they were
ignorant. If they'd known I was seeing some half-Erawan guy...

Thane: What if they didn't know? Do you think we would have gotten along?

Asra: I don't know. They would have been nice to you. You might not have liked
them so much.

Thane: ...

Asra: Do you think you'll be able to do any evincing in Rega?

Thane: I actually don't know. Rega is pretty close to the Erawan border. I might
be able to do something simple. Control a coin flip, maybe.

Asra: What was the evincer program like? Was it anything like your mom taught
you?

Thane: Mom never talked much about evincing. Gheni was way too far from the
Fracture for her to do stuff. She still talked about the spiritual aspect,
though.

Asra: So the training was different?

Thane: Definitely. It was secular, of course. There were only twenty of us, and
the whole thing was supposed to be under wraps. Mostly they just gave us the
enhancements and started off by having us rig dice.

Asra: Why dice? That doesn't make any sense.

Thane: Evincing is basically a glorified placebo effect.

Asra: Meaning what?

Thane: It's more than just willing things to happen. You have to believe they're
already happening. Stuff that's based on luck is easy because you can imagine it
happening already. The point is to skew the odds in your favor.

Asra: Did you ever spar with each other?

Thane: Eventually, yeah. Fighting is way harder because you can use your own
perception to suppress the other person's abilities. I was never great at it.
That, and there was the whole medical discharge thing, so I left early.

Asra: Yeah, what was that about? You've never explained why that happened.

Thane: That's because I don't understand it myself. They kept saying I was sick,
but I felt totally fine. They wouldn't even wait for me to recover.

# Diego stirs behind them.

Diego: How far's the black market from the station?

Asra: Not too far. Probably ten minutes or so on the trolley.

Diego: You haven't been here in years. You sure it's in the same spot?

Asra: It's run by the officers. Unless someone picked up the whole barracks and
put it down somewhere else I doubt it’s gone anywhere. Also...

# Asra points to a massive port in the distance.

Asra: That's where we want to go once we've got uniforms. Since the United
Territories of Debony is the only trade partner as far north we are, ships
commuting anywhere else should have tropical barnacles stuck to them.

Thane: And we're sure we want to go to Debony?

Diego: Distance is the key factor here. Every country in Kabel is trying to get
their hands on Cheminan engineers. We can expect political asylum pretty much
anywhere. What’s important is we make it to land before we’re discovered.

# The train begins slowing down. Thane points to a transit center milling with
# a large crowd. Snow begins to fall.

Thane: So can we transfer there?

Asra: That's weird. I've never seen the station this backed up before.

Soldier: Because our great leader is holding a rally at the square, the only
routes in service today are those running to or from the downtown area!

Asra: Nothing to boost your self-esteem like a captive audience.

Thane: Does that mean we're stuck here?

Asra: No, it just means we’ll have to transfer at the square instead of getting
a straight shot. And judging by the crowd, it might be a while before we get to
board.

<> # Meeting Vanna

# The trio enter a fishing supplies shop and confront the front desk.

Asra: Hey, Vanna.

Vanna: Asra. Haven’t seen you around. And you’ve got company, too.

Asra: Yeah. This is Diego. We’re looking to get him a uniform and dog tags.

Vanna: Your friend's pretty big. I doubt there's anything in the back that's
going to fit him. Say... What do you need a uniform for anyway?

Asra: We wanted to play dress-up.

Vanna: A bit old for that, aren't you?

Asra: It's a fetish.

Diego: Hey-

Vanna: I see you've still got your sense of humor. Well, I suppose it's not
really my business what you need it for anyway. Just don't let the officers
catch you... unless you're also a masochist. Which wouldn't surprise me.

Diego: How do we get a hold of something that fits?

Vanna: Someone sure is eager. I've got a friend on the other side of town that
should be able to help you.

<> # Leaving Vanna's

Diego: Is this place always so poorly stocked?

Asra: It's not. You're just a really big guy.

Diego: It's not that I'm big. It's that the rest of you are all so damned small.
Your generation grew up with refrigerators and ovens and no food to put in them.
It's hardly a surprise your growth was stunted.

Thane: I didn't know you had these kinds of connections in Rega.

Asra: What do you mean? Everyone has a supplier somewhere or other. My dad
wasn’t a revolutionary but that doesn’t mean we were naive. My parents took me
here since I was eleven.

Diego: Are you sure we can trust her?

Asra: I would think so. She doesn't know we're deserters. Besides, if there's
anything Vanna knows how to do it's keeping customers.

<> # Rally

# Somoza stands at a podium, delivering a speech.

Farid Somoza: Despite our recent defeat in Merad, it is only a matter of time
before we have secured control over the Fracture.

Farid Somoza: My rule began with the dream that we could create a nation of
unwavering advancement, and I stand here humbled by the efforts of the men and
women who are making this dream a reality.

Farid Somoza: The entirety of Kabel has already been transformed by our
collective innovations, and I promise you, we are now closer than we have ever
been to the dawn of a new age.

Farid Somoza: Progress can only move forward, and those who try to oppose us
will inevitably be crushed beneath its gears!

Asra: Do you think Somoza’s right about us moving into a new age?

Diego: I think change is coming. But I also think Somoza’s biting off more than
he can chew. If he keeps trying to trade technology like gold and spices it’s
going to blow up in his face.

Thane: Why? He's been leader my whole life and I've never seen something so much
as threaten his rule.

Diego: It's not about politics, it's about the technology itself. It’s taken all
of 40 years to go from steam engines to biplanes. Industrial growth helps
sovereign power, but it helps the market more.

Asra: Yeah, except Somoza controls the market, too.

Diego: His official position is supreme leader. Dictator or not, that title is
weighing him down. The market will help him, but it's also going to outgrow him.

Asra: You said yourself Chemina has a lock on technology. If Somoza won't be in
control of the economy, who will be?

Diego: Countries are already starting to reverse engineer our goods. It’s only a
matter of time before Chemina has competitors, and when that happens we’ll have
a second explosion of trade.

Thane: So anyone that wants to rule Kabel will have to do it through the
economy. But what's to say Somoza still won't be that person?

Diego: Have you heard him talk? Somoza's too stubborn to survive the changes
he's causing. Truth be told, I'm not sure any government is flexible enough to
take on changes like this and ride with it.

Asra: That makes even less sense. You still haven't said who's going to pick up
the slack and benefit the most from all this.

Diego: If I had to guess, I’d say pirates. But at the rate technology is going,
the factory owners might become separate entities altogether. The trick would be
if they could go international.

<> # Iron Sights

Thane: Hey, come look at this.

# Thane gestures to a window looking over Somoza.

Asra: Holy shit. We could totally hit him from here. What are the odds of an
opportunity like this?

Diego: Virtually nothing. Do we really want to though?

Thane: We can't pass up an opportunity like this.

Diego: Thane, listen to me closely. If you shoot him, all of us will die. I'm
not going to stop you, but you have to get that through your head.

<> # Asra: Assassination

Asra: This fucker started the war that killed my parents. He sent both of yours
away to die. He has to pay.

Thane: You realize there's no way we could get away with this, right?

Asra: This is going to sound impulsive, but I don't care. We're just three
people, Thane. What are our lives worth compared to the millions suffering
because of him?

Thane: Now you're starting to sound like the revolutionary. I didn't think you
would be so eager to do this.

Asra: My family might have been misinformed but we weren't naive. I was taught
in school to love Somoza, but we were also afraid. There's only so much you can
fear someone before you start to resent them.

Thane: I want Somoza dead too, but I also want to make it out of this country
alive. I want to have a future with you.

Asra: What if someone else had the same chance to kill him, but didn't. What if
they said the same thing you did? We can't let this slip through our fingers.

Thane: Weren't you just saying you were afraid of how bloodthirsty you were
becoming? Are you sure this is what you want?

Asra: This is different. I'm not the one holding the gun. And I've wanted Somoza
dead long before we decided we wanted to go to Debony. Believe it or not, I'm
actually quite calm right now.

Thane: But... Would you really rather have your vengeance than make it over the
border? Aren't you more important than that? Aren't I?

Asra: I don't want to bully you into getting yourself killed based on my whim.
If I were a good enough shot I'd shoot him myself and take full responsibility,
but I'm not. I don't think it's right for me to make the decision for us all.

Thane: You didn't answer my question. Does killing him mean that much to you?

Asra: I... don't know. I do love you. But what if we don't shoot him and we
still get caught trying to flee? What if we pass up this chance and it's all for
nothing?

Thane: What if I shoot and miss? There's always a chance something could go
wrong.

Asra: We have a really good position. I don't think you'll miss.

<> # Diego: Assassination

Diego: I'd think twice before pulling that trigger. You know his son is just
going to take over, right? Besides, his regime is doomed to fall even without
our help.

Thane: Yeah, but-

Diego: But what? What's done is done. You can't bring back the people that are
already dead, and killing Somoza now isn't going to help anyone either. Changing
the world is more complicated than shooting bad guys.

Thane: He still deserves to die.

Diego: Sure he does. But are you going to throw all of our lives away based on
who deserves what?

Thane: Are you telling me not to shoot him?

Diego: ... No. I don't ever want to tell someone the story about how my nephew
almost killed Farid Somoza until I talked him out of it. I could never live with
myself.

Thane: What do you want, then?

Diego: I'm staying neutral.

Thane: Is this some kind of vestigial journalistic objectivity? You never
change, do you?

Diego: Thane, my integrity went out the window after your mom was taken away. My
actions at that time were rooted in self-preservation. If that bothers you,
consider that I'm letting you make this choice yourself, even if it kills me.

Thane: You're just putting your life in my hands that easily? Does this mean
anything to you?

Diego: This is extremely important to me, but both choices have merit. That's
why I'm fine with whatever you choose to do.

<> # Breaking News: Defeat in Merad

Thane: "Our valiant soldiers continue their tug of war over Merad. Fourteen
Cheminan casualties were reported on the battlefields in the most recent battle,
but General Kowalski assures us that victory is simply a matter of patience."

Asra: What a crock of shit. We've been fighting over that miserable little town
for three years now. I'll bet the actual body count is forty.

Diego: I promise I didn't write that one... My articles are more ham-fisted.

Thane: Does this kind of stuff really raise morale?

Diego: I'll let you know when we run a story on how the war is actually going.

Asra: That sounds like a real test of patience.

<> # Breaking News: Night Patrol Killed

Thane: "Early this morning, officers found several of squadmates in Gheni dead
while doing rounds. Forensics confirmed the cause of death to be multiple
gunshot wounds from Civil War-era weapons."

Diego: Let me guess. A reward-

Thane: "A handsome reward shall be offered to any who provide evidence leading
to the capture of the suspects."

Asra: Thane... Can I talk to you about something?

Thane: Of course. What's going on?

Asra: I'm a murderer now. And the... thing is... fuck.

Thane: Trust me, I know. It's hard to-

Asra: It's not hard! That's why I'm so fucking scared!

Thane: ...

Asra: I never wanted to be drafted into the service. I never wanted to be a
medic, either. But I was able to accept it because I could tell myself at least
I was helping people. But something about killing just felt... exciting.

Thane: Everyone has their own way of handling taking a life.

Asra: It's not even about that. It's that I liked it! What does that say about
who I am? What if I just get worse and I lose control? This isn't who I want to
be.

Thane: It's going to be alright. We're not soldiers and we're not here to fight.
Once we're in Debony you won't have to think about any of this anymore.

Asra: Even if we make it... I'm scared of myself, Thane.

Thane: I can't promise everything will be fine, but give yourself time. You'll
at least feel better than you do now.

<> # Breaking News: Invention of Television

Thane: "Physicists use amplitude-modulated frequencies to transmit images via
cathode ray tubes. A union of motion pictures and remote broadcasts is expected
to reach the market later this year."

Diego: I didn't understand half of that.

Asra: And here I was thinking you were the educated gentleman.

Diego: I never said that. I just said you kids never learn the things you really
need to know in school.

Asra: Oh yeah? What's the last thing you invented?

Thane: Asra, don't-

Diego: It's not about what I've invented, or what anyone's invented for that
matter. You two grow up practically illiterate and completely ignorant of your
own history, and then you think engineering is the only thing worth knowing.

Asra: Not everyone has to be like you, Diego! Different people-

Diego: Everyone needs to know why things are the way they are right now! You
can't raise a whole generation of engineers to be subservient workers that shirk
their collective responsibility as citizens and then expect a revolution.

Asra: What about you? Your own brother risked his life in the Civil War and all
you did was stand on the sidelines and watch!

Thane: Stop!!

Asra: ...

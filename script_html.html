Spend Rega chapter delving into Asra's character arc. Have her overcome her fear
of becoming addicted to killing (in other words, 'fake' development.)

Symptoms of psychosis:
depression			difficulty concentrating	hallucinations
anxiety				suspiciousness				delusions
social withdrawal	disorganized speech
suicide				poor sleep

Thane should show more signs of distress in Tripsi/Rega
	* Thane is initially distrustful of Oda?
	* Thane almost screws up getting through the border?
	* Inconsistencies in rebels in Rega?
	* Thane accidentally kills someone in Rega?
	
Rega Rebellion - fake conspiracies revealed
	* "Rega Massacre was an inside job"
	* "Nenegi assault was an inside job, Chemina paid Erawan mercenaries"
	* "Rega rebels were running a sting operation"
Thane and Dagan are sent on a mission with another rebel. Because it's a suicide
mission, Thane kills the rebel rather than risk his life and tries to return to
the rebel base.
(2 part mission so they enter and exit via separate routes?)
Thane can't make it back to base through sewers, thinks he was set up.

Thane encounters a man claiming to be part of a rebellion to overthrow Somoza.
He offers Thane a place to sleep, in a rebel base located in the sewers. When he
wakes up, the man tries to convince Thane to join him, then threatens him when
he declines. Thane reluctantly accepts, and is sent to destroy a power plant.
While in the sewer tunnels, Thane betrays and kills a rebel sent with him. The
end of the tunnel leads directly to a military compound, leading Thane to
suspect he was set up from the beginning. He retreats back to the rebel base but
is forced to fight his way out.

<div class="content">

The industrial revolution began in the remote country of Chemina, only to be
hijacked by military dictator Farid Somoza. In the following decades, the first
world's struggle to reduce its dependence on foreign technology has created a
vacuum which Cheminan refugees are only too happy to fill. Follow Thane and his
family as they fight tooth and nail to flee the country.

Distant future: Erawa is invaded partially; Erawans retreat closer toward the
fracture and break the Euclidean space further, to the point where the distance
between the invaded territory and their retreat is practically infinite. No one
is able to penetrate this defense, and so the Erawan people are forgotten.

Chemina is only partly successful in utilizing the Fracture; they can
efficiently mix chemicals (100% percent yield) but are unsuccessful in creating
infinite energy. Debony manages to reproduce nearly all of Chemina's technology,
squelching Chemina's stronghold over technology; however, Chemina remains a
successful exporter and maintains a strong economy.

Debony's technology is used to mine natural resources in Lamenir. This causes
the country to begin developing, and rebel factions begin fighting back against
Debony. In response, Debony develops Pronsi, a drug with extremely potent
withdrawal symptoms leading to death. Pronsi is used to keep Lamenirian slaves
under control, but as slaves develop a tolerance to Pronsi, they require more of
it to stave off withdrawal symptoms. Debony is soon unable to produce enough of
the drug, wiping out nearly the entire continent of Lamenir. Automation is then
employed to mine resources instead.

During the chaos in Lamenir, the territory of Lebre fights a losing battle to
remain independent. Politicians ultimately acquiesce and agree to quell the
revolutionaries - their former allies - in the remainder of Lamenir. Several
military units desert and defect in rebellion.

Debony is the first country to develop radio signals capable of reaching Xeon;
however, Xeon does not have the technology to receive such signals. Chemina
launches the first rocket to land in Xeon.

Artificial intelligence developed in Debony is discovered to have manipulated 
public opinion using social media as well as outright assassinating influential
figures in accordance with its goal of "benefiting humanity." The AI determined
that human susceptibility to oligarchy stems from the obedience of the common
man rather than greed of the few, and aims to change habits inherent to the
masses over the course of nearly 200 years.

This artificial intelligence is challenged by a collective superintelligence
formed from prehistoric coral reef, which manipulates underground volcanos to
destroy strategic sections of the AI's architecture.

<button class="collapsible">Classroom</button>
<div class="content">

[A teacher stands at the front of a classroom, lecturing.]

Teacher: Construction on Chemina's railway system exploded in the early 1890s,
and its growth continued to accelerate until Erawa invaded in 1907. We're
fortunate that Somoza took office before then. If he hadn't weeded out the
Erawan spies, we'd surely have lost the war before it began.

Child 1: Why did Erawa attack us?

Teacher: Take a look at what was happening at the time. In the past century we'd
invented the steam engine and electrical power. Erawa's culture is extremely
regressive. They rely on witchcraft because it's the only thing they've ever
known. Our society was changing rapidly, and it scared them. They hate our way
of life and wanted to destroy it.

Child 2: Teacher?

Teacher: Yes?

Child 2: My mom said Somoza was the one that started the war. Is that true?

Teacher: That was certainly the narrative the Erawan Department of Intelligence
told. As I was saying earlier, Erawa had planted a lot of spies. Many of them
had infiltrated the media to spread misinformation and rile up Erawan
sympathizers.

Child 2: ... I see.

Teacher: Oh, and Keola? I'd like to speak with you after class.

Keola: Yes, teacher.

Teacher: Anyway, our railroads are still growing, just not as fast. The same can
be said of our other developments. For instance, the war effort has forced the
government to cut funding for medical research. Of course, if Erawa had its way,
we'd still be using crystal healing and leeches. So you can see how important
it is for us to support our troops.

<button class="collapsible">Horseback</button>
<div class="content">

[Four men ride through a jungle on horseback.]

Biggs: Can't stand these damned beasts. I've found corpses that didn't smell
this bad.

Wedge: You know, Biggs, I've found corpses that've smelled better than you, too.

Bane: They're the best mounts we have for the mission. An armored vehicle just
isn't going to cut it on this terrain. Not to mention how much racket the
engine would make if we rolled through here in a Vollmer.

Wedge: We haven't seen signs of life in hours, Captain. There's no one around to
hear us.

Bane: Don't sound so disappointed. We haven't even crossed the border into Merad
yet.

[Wedge's horse inadvertently splashes muddy water on Saito.]

Bane: Shit. Saito, that didn't splash the dynamite, did it?

Saito: No, sir. Still dry.

Biggs: I still don't know why we're trusting him with that stuff? Wasn't his
wife an Erawan?

Saito: (Does he really have to bring that up every chance he gets?)

Bane: Saito is the only explosives expert here. The mission depends on his
expertise. Unless you have a better way of causing an avalanche?

Biggs: ...

Wedge: Captain, ahead!

[The group stops and looks in the direction Wedge is pointing.]

Saito: I only see one. If he's got any squadmates, they're lurking just out of
sight.

Bane: Wedge, did intel say anything about another way around?

Wedge: No, sir. One way in, one way out.

Bane: Alright, men. We'll take this one out, then continue on foot.

<button class="collapsible">Innocents</button>
<div class="content">

[After a skirmish with Erawan soldiers.]

Wedge: Fuck, those things are loud. What are they?

Saito: The projectiles are called flat bombs. You compress an object to a
fraction of its original size, and when you let it expand again, it explodes.

Biggs: Sounds like a bunch of black magic to me.

Saito: You're not far off. You have to trick your own perception to make it
shrink. Whether or not it works depends on-

Biggs: Don't care.

Bane: Stay on task. The supply base is at the bottom of the hill. The point
serves as an intermediary between manufacturing and the barracks.

Wedge: Wait, why do they need munitions? Can't they just make these "flat bombs"
whenever they need one?

Saito: It might be sharpnel.

Wedge: Shrapnel?

Saito: Sharp-nel. Two-dimensional blades. Razor sharp. You can't even feel it go
through you, but the stuff cuts to the bone. Takes time to prepare, though, so
they mass-produce it ahead of time.

Biggs: Enough of this shit. Let's blow it up.

Wedge: Is there a way to specifically target the base? Looks like a lot of those
are civilian buildings.

Saito: Not the way we're doing it. If we blast the mountainside, we'll wipe out
half the village.

Biggs: So much the better. Only good Erawan's a dead Erawan.

Wedge: Captain?

Bane: The briefing says nothing about minimizing collateral damage. Our
objective is to destroy the supply base, so that's what we're going to do.

Saito: (I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.)

Bane: Don't look at me like that. The supply base is in the middle of the
village for a purpose. They're banking on people like you shying away from
civilian casualties... and holding their own people hostage in the process.

Saito: You think proving them wrong is that important? There must be hundreds of
people down there.

Bane: (Sigh) Leave the storybook idealism at the door. This isn't a fairytale.
This is war. Biggs and I will cover you in case someone else comes through.

<div class="content">

[Saito and Wedge walk along the edge of the cliff.]

Wedge: Doesn't it bug you that we're burying a bunch of civilians alive?

Saito: Can't let myself think about it too much. My son's back home and if I
ever want to see him again I've gotta keep my head down.

Wedge: Biggs sure can be a shithead, yeah?

Saito: I hardly even hear it anymore. Why would I care what he thinks? Though I
appreciate the show of solidarity.

Wedge: What was your wife like? If you don't mind me asking, of course.

Saito: Phaedra was an interesting character. She had a huge rebellious streak.
One of the reasons she came to Chemina in the first place. But she still had a
lot of respect for where she came from, if that makes sense.

Wedge: I take it things went south when the war started?

Saito: Yeah. She was hauled off, probably to some labor camp in Nenegi. I
haven't heard from her since.

Wedge: I'm sorry.

[Beat]

Saito: We need to find a hole along a fault line in the rock, otherwise it's not
going to bring anything down. That one would work if we could reach it.

[Saito gestures to a long, vertical crack, several meters away horizontally.]

Wedge: What are you talking about? That's an easy traverse.

Saito: You sure about that? One slip and you'd be toast. And this fuse is only
good for 30 seconds.

Wedge: Watch and learn, my friend.

[Wedge traverses to a small landing and prepares to light the fuse. Gunshots
can be heard in the distance.]

Saito: Hey, Wedge? I heard gunshots!

Wedge: Then cover me. I'm a little busy, if you couldn't-

Saito: Look out!

[An Erawan higher on the cliff fires off several flat bombs, blasting Wedge off
the cliff.]

Saito: Shit!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Regroup</button>
<div class="content">

[Saito encounters Biggs trading fire with an Erawan from behind cover. Saito
shoots the distracted Erawan and joins Biggs behind cover.]

Saito: (Never thought I'd be happy to see Biggs.)

Biggs: Hey! Where's Wedge?

[Saito looks down and shakes his head.]

Biggs: Fuck.

Saito: What about Bane?

Biggs: No clue. There was an ambush and we got separated.

Saito: Great. Well, we blew the mountainside. Let's get the fuck out of here.

[A tree shrivels to the size of a twig, revealing a child soldier, who uproots
it and throws it at them.]

Biggs: Shit!!

[Saito is sent flying and Biggs is impaled on a branch. The Erawan inspects
Biggs' body. Saito draws a grenade, pulls the pin, but it explodes instantly.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Infirmary</button>
<div class="content">

Saito: (Fuck this hurts! I can barely think. What happened? My grenade... went
off in my hand? And then...? I'm... in a hospital bed. And that tapping...
Someone's using a telegraph.)

???: ... R HAND. 3RD DEG BURNS ON ARM. TRAUM BRAIN INJ. MULT FRACTURES.

???: CAN RECOVER?

???: STABLE, BUT FULL RECOVERY IMPOSSIBLE.

???: CAN HE FIGHT?

???: NO.

???: PUT HIM DOWN.

[Beat]

???: ARE YOU SURE?

???: YES.

Saito: (Is this how it ends? Mauled by a defective grenade and euthanized in a
medical tent? No, they can't be talking about me.) 

[Footsteps approach the hospital curtain.]

Saito: (Well I'm not going down without a fight.)

[Saito feigns sleep. When the nurse swabs his arm, he jerks up and strikes her
in the chest. Blood gushes from Saito's right arm, only a stump. He screams.]

Saito: What happened... to my arm?

[The nurse finishes injecting Saito and he collapses.]

<button class="collapsible">Death Letter</button>
<div class="content">

[A young couple sits at the foot of a bed, holding a letter. Standing at the
window looking out is a middle-aged man.]

Thane: "I regret to inform you that Saito Belikoff was reported killed in action
while deployed in Merad, Erawa. I hope you can find solace in the knowledge of
his heroic service to the state. I extend my deepest sympathy to you."

[Beat]

Thane: Dad...

Asra: I'm so sorry, Thane.

Thane: No. This can't... why?

Dagan: It's time to leave. There's nothing left for us here.

Thane: But... what if they're lying?

Dagan: So what if they are? Maybe he's dead. Maybe he was captured. Maybe they
fucking euthanized him. Asra said they've started doing that when soldiers can't
fight anymore. It doesn't matter what happened. He's not coming home, and that
means it's time to pack up.

Thane: ... Why now?

Asra: There isn't much for us to wait around for, is there? I'm sure I'll be
deployed soon.

Thane: (She's right. Somoza always keeps one member per household on active duty
so their families can't escape without leaving them behind. I'd barely been
discharged when they drafted Dad.)

Dagan: Get the books from the cellar. I don't want them laying around after we
leave. The last thing we need is for them to find a bunch of contraband if we
get caught jumping the border.

Thane: I feel like we should be talking about-

Dagan: There's nothing to talk about. We've discussed this all already. Your
father is dead, and we're leaving to Debony. I was ready for this letter to come
the moment he was drafted, so let's get moving.

Asra: Whoa, that is completely uncalled for! Can't you give us five fucking
minutes to grieve?

Thane: It's okay, Asra. He's right.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Asra: Dagan's Apathy</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra follows Thane down the stairs from the bedroom.]

Asra: How can Dagan care so little about his own brother?

Thane: Dagan's lost a lot of family. He doesn't have the energy to grieve
anymore. But you shouldn't take that to mean that he doesn't care.

Asra: And what about you? Are you going to be okay?

Thane: I don't know. I'm kind of in shock. It's gonna take some time to process
everything that's going through my head right now. What about you?

Asra: Is it bad if I say I'm really ready to leave this place?

Thane: No. You're in the military reserve. I'm sure you're thinking how easily
that letter could have been about you instead.

Asra: Actually... I was thinking about how both of our parents are gone now. I
just want to go somewhere else and not think about all of this anymore. But I
feel like that's mentally pushing your dad under the rug.

Thane: I can't expect you to feel the same way about my dad as I do. You barely
knew him. Besides, Dagan seems pretty ready to leave, too.

Asra: Heh... Can't believe we finally agree on something.

<button class="collapsible">Dagan: Traveling Together</button>
<div class="content">

[Dagan comes downstairs and sees Thane.]

Dagan: What's the matter? Is the vent stuck?

Thane: No, I haven't been down to the cellar yet.

Dagan: I told you to get those books. We need to make sure they're gone before
we get raided.

[Asra sighs and leaves the room.]

Thane: Are you going to be okay travelling with Asra? I know you two don't get
along.

Dagan: Asra's the only one with connections that could get us out of here. Plus
she knows you're half Erawan. If we left her here she'd be taken into custody,
and then what?

Thane: She wouldn't tell them anything.

Dagan: I won't sicken you with horror stories, but you should really know
better. We're bringing her along. For her sake and yours.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Book Cellar</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane enters a cellar. Against one wall is a bookshelf. On the other, the old
Cheminan flag. Transparent images of Thane and Saito appear before him.]

Thane: (Why do you keep this old thing? You do realize what would happen if
someone found it down here, right?)

Saito: (Of course I do. That's why it's here.)

Thane: (Do you have a death wish or something?)

Saito: (You're not old enough to remember just how little is left from before
Somoza's reign. They burned every flag they could get their hands on. It's a
miracle this one survived. So no, I'm not getting rid of it.)

Thane: (It's a miracle you survived, too. Isn't that worth something?)

Saito: (If you knew how things used to be, you would understand.)

Asra: Whoa. This place is crazy.

Thane: Ah!

[The transparent figures vanish.]

Asra: Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. You were down here a while. Still
bringing this stuff back up?

Thane: Yeah, but... It seems like such a waste to burn them.

Asra: Would you rather be tried as a renegade or traitor? If we get caught,
these are the difference between the gallows and thumbscrews. They have to go.

Thane: But they're Dad's.

Asra: Thane, he's not coming back.

Thane: I know. Just... Give me a minute.

Asra: This is my first time in here. Now I see why the regular basement is so
small. Did Saito do all this himself?

Thane: Kind of. He was the one that bricked it up the basement and made it two
rooms. My mom made the secret entrance for this half.

Asra: That must have been a long time ago. Did Dagan help, too?

Thane: He refused. I guess he didn't agree with them keeping contraband in the 
first place.

Asra: I knew you guys had a collection of banned books, but I never imagined it
would look this cool. I wish I'd come down here earlier. That flag looks like an
antique.

Thane: It's not that much older than we are. Probably just looks like it
because we never see them anymore.

Asra: I can't believe your dad fought against Somoza's regime back before he
rose to power. Your family's so much cooler than mine.

Thane: Didn't do them much good, did it? Mom died in the internment camps, and
now Dad's... I'm sorry. It's not like you haven't lost family yourself.

Asra: I'm still grateful, you know. After the Rega Massacre you were all I had
left. There were a lot of people that had nowhere to go. I'm lucky you were
there to take me in. Thank you.

Thane: Asra, I love you. You know I love you. Did you really think I wouldn't
help you?

Asra: I'm still thankful.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Erawa At a Glance</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: I've always wanted to know more about Erawa. I mean, aside from what I 
learned in school.

Thane: Asra, you know what we were taught was-

Asra: I know, I know.

[Asra opens the book.]

Asra: "Paranormal phenomena were first observed in Erawa in the sixth century,
though their nature has been closely guarded by the Erawan Empire. Nearly half a 
millennia passed before it was observed that the magnitude and frequency of
these events correlated with their proximity to the center of the peninsula."

Asra: "Legends of Erawan magicians known as 'evincers' have existed for
centuries. However, it wasn't until defected practitioners were interviewed that
scientists theorized the center of Erawa's landmass contained a 'subjective
fracture in objective reality,' which enabled the temporary suspension of
physical law."

Asra: I was always told it was some kind of electric charge that hovered in the
air.

Thane: Yeah. Not even my mom would have described it the way this book does. She
just said the land was sacred.

Asra: "Evincers trained to exploit the Fracture, primarily by manipulating the
natural tundra into a tropical rainforest suitable for agriculture and resource
production, as well as a source of military power during the period of Cheminan
colonization."

Asra: Wait, I've heard of the Fracture. Although I don't really understand how
it works.

Thane: It's sort of like a zone where reality becomes increasingly unstable. But
to be honest, I don't completely understand it myself.

Asra: "Erawa's geography is also a topic of debate. According to mythology, its
distinct shape is a result of ancient evincers causing the land to physically
expand out from the Fracture itself, resulting in a perfectly circular landmass.
However, skeptics argue that such profound influence over the terrain so far
from the center is virtually impossible."

Asra: I guess that does sound kind of far-fetched, but how else could the island
be shaped like that?

Thane: Technically it's not a circle, since Chemina still borders it. But you're
right, the shape is bizarre. I can't think of any reason for that to happen
naturally. Then again, I'm not a geophysicist, so what do I know?

Asra: "The exact nature of the Fracture is unknown - reality becomes
increasingly unstable as one approaches it. Within a forty-mile radius, objects
from an observer's imagination begin to materialize, and objects not being
actively observed may dematerialize. Beyond a thirty mile radius, unconscious
eye movements cause earthquakes, and measurement tools such as rulers, begin to
malfunction. Experienced evincers are able to dampen these effects, but there
are no confirmed records of the center having been reached."

Asra: I had no idea the center was so dangerous.

Thane: Yeah, my mom said the whole country is based around how close people live
to the middle. The book explains it more in detail.

Asra: "Because of this, Erawa is divided into five territories shaped like
concentric rings around the center."

Asra: "The ectosphere houses civilians, whose prowess in evincing is typically
modest."

Thane: That's where my mom lived.

Asra: "The endosphere is home to the aristocracy, who wield significantly more
potent supernatural abilities."

Asra: "Beyond this layer is the introsphere, which requires specific training
and discipline to enter safely. As a result, only devoted evincers and shaman
are able to live here."

Asra: "The metasphere lies beyond this, and while the effects of the Fracture
are too potent for this area to be permanently inhabitable, it is often a staple
of an evincer's spiritual journey."

Asra: "The cryptosphere is the innermost layer, and is the event horizon for
all human activity. Those that cross this boundary are never seen again."

Asra: "The nature of the center is a topic of fierce debate. It's posited that
the center itself may not have any concrete shape, as such complete subversion
of objective reality might contradict the idea of a physical form. Cheminan
philosopher Zeke Salow postulated that a point of purely subjective reality
might 'explain the spark of consciousness that transformed blood-bots into what
we call life.'"

Asra: So he's saying subjective experience originated from the Fracture? Like,
we'd all be philosophical zombies without it?

Thane: Supposedly. I don't really understand the reasoning behind it.

Asra: It kind of makes sense, but it doesn't account for the connection between
subjective experience and life.

Thane: Well, nothing else does, either.

Asra: That doesn't prove the Fracture is involved.

Thane: I'm not trying to saying the theory is right or wrong. I'm just saying it
sounds like as good an explanation as any. But I'm not trying to make any kind
of definitive conclusion and I'm not the person to talk to about abstract
existential stuff like this.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Colonialization in Lamenir</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: "Lamenir has a unique ecological history; it is the only landmass with no
natural hunters. As all of its native meat-eaters have instead adapted to living
as scavengers, aggressive behavior is not observed among wildlife or people."

Thane: "It is the lack of aggression in the Lamenir people for which its
subjugation is often attributed. Indeed, it took less than a century for 40% of
its total population to be enslaved by Debonese colonialists."

Thane: "In recent years, mining of raw materials in Lamenir has become a staple
in the global economy, supplying Chemina with coal and iron which are refined
into consumer goods and shipped around the globe."

Asra: Ugh. Are you sure fleeing to Debony is a good idea?

Thane: We're Cheminan. That's different.

Asra: But... Debony sounds just as evil as Chemina. Maybe worse.

Thane: We're not going to Debony for moral reasons. We're going there because
they have a better use for us than making us fight.

Asra: That sounds like something Dagan would say. "Life is misery. A job is
misery... WITH compensation."

Thane: (Laughs) I don't think he's quite THAT nihilistic. But you're right. He
told me that when Dad was drafted. The part about going to Debony, I mean.

Asra: Wait, he wanted to leave while Saito was on active duty!?

Thane: Well, no. He said we needed a contingency plan in case something happened
to him. I didn't want to talk about it at the time, but here we are.

Asra: Does Dagan care about ANYONE?

Thane: He was really close with my mom, back when she was still around. And he
does cares about me. He's just not good at showing it. And as insensitive as he
can be, he's usually right.

Asra: He can be right all he wants. I just wish he wasn't such an ass about it.

Thane: Yeah, me too.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Erawan Scriptures</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra hands the Erawan Scriptures to Thane.]

Asra: Can you read this?

Thane: The last time anyone could've read it was when Mom was around.

Asra: I thought you knew Erawan.

Thane: My mom taught me a some growing up, but only spoken. I don't know how to
read at all.

Asra: So why keep the scriptures after Phaedra was taken?

Thane: Dad didn't want to let go of anything that reminded him of her. It's
definitely not the safest decision he's made. All of these are banned, but
Erawan literature would be the biggest liability by far.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">A Brief History</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: Have you read all of these?

Thane: Most, but my dad pushed me to read the ones about Chemina's history the
most. A Brief History of Cheminan-Erawan Relations was his favorite.

[Thane picks another book from the shelf.]

Thane: "Due to the Erawan Empire's reliance on a natural landmark which proved
ineffective outside of the local territory, the state adopted isolationist
policies, much to the detriment of foreign relations."

Thane: "Erawan-Cheminan diplomacy only soured in the wake of Chemina's
industrialization, during which engineers proposed using the Fracture to
construct a perpetual energy machine."

Thane: "This sparked outrage among Erawan activists who considered technological
exploitation of the Fracture heresy, escalating political tensions to an all-out
war."

Asra: Wait, what!? I knew this was a resource war, but I didn't think Somoza was
trying to do anything that crazy!

Thane: Well, you're still a step ahead of everyone that thinks Erawa started the
war.

Asra: I don't know whether to be flattered or depressed.

Thane: "Although Chemina has no shortage of trade partners following their
emergence as an economic superpower, the possibility of military intervention by
a foreign body is slim."

Thane: "Developed countries have expressed concerns over Chemina's political
instability and the risk of its supreme leader Farid Somoza using the Fracture
to wage a world war, were it ever secured. Consequently, the two nations have
been locked in a stalemate."

Thane: There's a tear on the page. Dad wouldn't read me part of it because he
was afraid I'd talk about it in school. I threw a tantrum and tried to grab it
out of his hand.

Asra: How old were you?

Thane: Five.

Asra: Damn. That's pretty young to be lecturing your kid about politics.

Thane: He said all the children's books were "nationalistic garbage" so he read
these to me instead. Even though he had to paraphrase most of it. Guess he's not
here to protect the book from me this time.

Asra: You shouldn't think of it that way. Those books made you who you are.
They've served their purpose. We're burning them now because we're making room 
or a new life - one where we can be safe from Somoza and this stupid war. If
Saito could see you now he'd be proud.

Thane: What makes you say that? You never even knew him.

Asra: Okay. What would he really think of you?

Thane: I guess... He would have been proud. Probably.

Asra: See? This is the best thing we can do right now. Now come over here and
hold me.

Thane: ... I'm going to miss him.

Asra: I know.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Book Burning</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane stands at the fireplace, holding a pile of books in a shovel.]

Thane: Does anyone want to look at these one last time?

Dagan: ...

Thane: (Please?)

[Thane thrusts the books into the fire and Dagan leaves the room.]

Asra: Guess the censors won.

Thane: Weren't you just saying we had to get rid of these?

Asra: Yeah. Dagan can't be too happy about this. Wasn't he a war correspondent
during the Civil War?

Thane: Kind of. Things got... weird.

Asra: What, because he pledged loyalty to Somoza?

Thane: Kind of? Even before Somoza won, Dagan wanted to stay neutral. He mostly
just reported numbers and took photos.

Asra: You said he liked Phaedra, right? Surely he cared that she was taken away?

Thane: It's... complicated. By the time Mom was captured, it was clear Somoza
was going to win. I guess Dagan wanted to be on the winning side. Even Dad did,
although he kind of had to for my sake.

Asra: He lost his wife, pledged his loyalty to the man that had her killed, and
after all that Somoza forced him back onto the battlefield. That's so fucked up.

Thane: Asra, I really don't want to think about that right now...

Asra: And now all Dagan does is write pro-Somoza propaganda.

Thane: I don't know what to tell you. He's a good writer and it pays the bills.
Neither of us would be here if it weren't for him. That said, a lot of those
books were his. You'd think he'd at least care a little about burning them.

Asra: You said it yourself, didn't you? He did what he had to in order to get
by. We all have feelings but we can't let them get in the way of doing what has
to be done.

<button class="collapsible">Cheminan Engineering</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra opens the refrigerator.]

Asra: Did you want the last brownie?

Thane: All yours.

[She pops it into her mouth.]

Asra: I always thought it was weird how often you and Dagan made sweets.

Thane: When I was little, there were several years where we were really poor.
Meat was too expensive so we mostly lived on beans and rice. Sugar was cheap, so
instead of fancy meals we had fancy desserts.

Asra: That's not a bad solution. These things are tasty.

Thane: There was a time when we couldn't even get eggs or milk, so Dagan would
ask the neighbors for leftover citrus peels and we'd candy those.

[Dagan enters the kitchen and looks at the refrigerator.]

Dagan: It's a shame we can't bring the appliances with us. We won't get this
kind of modern convenience anywhere else in the world.

Thane: Aren't you always talking about how much better the United Territories
is?

Dagan: Maybe politically, but their technology isn't nearly as modern. This
refrigerator alone would cost a small fortune overseas.

Asra: That's going to be hard to get used to. Eating cattle the same day it's
slaughtered and all that.

Dagan: Huh? Who told you that?

Asra: That's what we were told in school.

Dagan: Well it's a load of shit. Debony's still got all the basic necessities.
Ice boxes, horse and buggy, that kind of stuff. Not so different from how
Chemina was back when Saito and I were growing up.

Thane: Come on, Dagan. You've seen what I had to read for class. You must have
known they were feeding us lies.

Dagan: At least you had your father to tell you how much of it was bullshit.
I can't imagine growing up the way you kids do.

Asra: If you're interested, Thane left some great books in the fireplace. Hey,
that's the closest thing I've seen to a facial expression since I moved in.

Dagan: We're wasting time.

<button class="collapsible">Police State</button>
<div class="content">

[There's a loud knock at the door.]

Asra: What the-

Thane: Who's there?

Officer: Gheni Police Department. Open up!

[Thane reluctantly opens the door, revealing two officers.]

Officer: We're looking to for a Thane Belikoff.

Thane: Uh...

Officers: You need to come with us.

Thane: Hold on, I'm in-

[One officer raises a gun.]

Officers: If you don't cooperate, we are authorized to use force.

[Two gunshots sound and the officers collapse, dead. Dagan stands behind Thane,
holding a rifle.]

Asra: Holy shit!

Thane: Fuck! Fuck! Dagan, what the fuck?

[Dagan drags both bodies inside and shuts the door.]

Dagan: Quit standing around. We have to move! Take these.

[Dagan hands Thane a rifle and Asra a revolver.]

Asra: Dagan, you know I'm a medic, right? I can't shoot.

[Dagan fetches three backpacks and checks their contents while speaking.]

Dagan: Thane can teach you later. For now, just hold onto it.

Thane: You just fucking shot two officers. What-

Dagan: It was either that or let them haul you away to some black site.

Thane: Where did these guns even come from?

Dagan: Your father was a bit of a kleptomaniac. When it was clear Somoza was
winning the war, he started collecting weapons from fallen enemies. Once the war
was over his service weapon was taken but he was able to hide these.

Thane: I had no idea. Wait, why weren't they in the book cellar?

Dagan: Fuck if I know. Saito hid them in the bedroom. Pretty reckless
considering what would have happened if we'd ever been raided, but I guess
keeping them handy finally paid off.

Asra: Good thing we're already packed.

Thane: What do they even want from me?

Dagan: Who knows? Maybe they double-checked Saito's family records and realized
you were half Erawan. No use worrying about it now. But we really do have to get
out of here.

Thane: Just to be clear, we're headed for Nenegi, right?

Asra: Yeah. That's where Vanna is. She'll help us escape.

[Dagan rushes to the back door and opens it.]

Dagan: Fuck. It's after curfew. Look, in case things go to shit-

Asra: They already have.

Dagan: (Sigh) Avoid shootouts. If you see a patrol unit, go around. If you
can't, take them out before they know you're there. Don't let them shoot back.
Period.

Thane: Is this how the Civil War was fought?

Dagan: More or less. Somoza had a huge advantage in firepower, so rebels like
your father had to be a little more creative.

Asra: Sounds more underhanded than anything.

Dagan: "Underhanded" is a word used to demonize civilian resistance. There is no
other way to confront an organized force.

Asra: I thought we weren't trying to confront anyone.

Dagan: We're not. We're running and hiding. But you should still be prepared to
shoot if you have to. This isn't like what you saw in Erawa.

[Thane picks up a newspaper and begins to read.]

Thane: "Our valiant soldiers continue their tug of war over Merad. Nineteen
Cheminan casualties were reported on the battlefields this past week. However,
General Jaromir assures us that victory is simply a matter of patience."

Asra: Patience! What is it, three years we've been fighting over that miserable
little town? I'm sure "be patient" is what every mother wants to hear when her
son gets shipped back with half of his limbs blown off.

Dagan: If you think reading these stories is bad, imagine having to write them.

Thane: Does this kind of stuff really raise morale?

Dagan: Fuck if I know. We don't exactly do A/B testing at the press.

Asra: Are they talking about Saito's unit?

Dagan: Doubtful. Saito was an explosives expert. It wouldn't have made sense to
put him on the front lines.

Asra: How did he end up doing that?

Dagan: He had plenty of experience blowing stuff up from the Civil War. Made it
a lot easier to train him.

Asra: Wait, Saito was a terrorist!?

Dagan: (Laughs) You could say that.

Dagan: Asra, grab him. We need to get him somewhere safe.

Thane: No, I'm okay. Let's keep moving.

Asra: Are you sure?

Thane: Yeah... Shit, here comes more of them!

[More troops approach.]

Dagan: I don't-

Thane: Shit!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Trainyard</button>
<div class="content">

[The group sneaks into a trainyard.]

Dagan: We'll need to be really careful here. First sign of trouble and you can
bet they'll search every inch of this place before another train leaves.

Asra: We also need to figure out which ones are headed to Nenegi.

[The group sneaks between cars for a bit, eventually finding a tank car.]

Thane: If any of the tankers are carrying liquid explosives they'd definitely be
headed to Nenegi.

Dagan: Most are probably just petrol, in which case they could be going
anywhere.

Thane: The valves at the top should have different warnings depending on the
contents. We could climb up and check.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Narrow Escape</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra is on top of one of the tanker cars, with Thane and Dagan waiting below.]

Watchman: You there! Hands where I can see them!

[A guard approaches, gun aimed at Asra. Thane and Dagan retreat into the
shadows. Asra slowly turns toward the watchman and raises her hands.]

Watchman: Bit past your bedtime, isn't it, miss? Get down from there. Now.

[Asra slowly climbs down and turns to face the watchman.]

Watchman: What were you doing up there?

Asra: ...

Watchman: Not a talker, eh? Alright then.

[The watchman slams the butt of his rifle into Asra's gut, causing her to fall
to the ground. Thane raises his gun, but Dagan stops him and shakes his head.]

Watchman: Still don't feel like talking?

[The watchman brings his boot down between Asra's legs and digs his heel into
her.]

Thane: Bastard!

[Thane shoves Dagan off of him and shoots the watchman in the head, then rushes
over to Asra.]

Dagan: Thane, you idiot!

Thane: Are you alright?

Asra: ... Yeah. Let's hide.

[Thane helps Asra to her feet, only for the train to begin moving almost
immediately.]

Dagan: What the-

Asra: Jump on! That tanker's carrying nitro.

[The group grabs onto a ladder and climb up onto a car carrying lumber. Asra
slips beneath a tarp covering the car.]

Asra: Peekaboo!

Thane: (She sure is resilient.)

[Thane and Dagan follow suit and join her inside the train car.]

Dagan: Would you mind telling me why you led us into this death trap? There's no
way the conductor heard a gunshot and decided to just ignore it.

Asra: I think that's exactly what happened. Sure beats having to spend several
hours giving the police a statement and then explaining to your boss why a
shipment is late.

Dagan: If that is what happened, we're damn lucky the conductor was already in
the pilot. Thane, what the fuck were you thinking?

Thane: Are you being serious right now? What was I supposed to do, just sit by
and watch?

Dagan: He had his back to you. You could have held him at gunpoint without
firing. You could have used your knife. Shooting him was beyond reckless.

Asra: Dagan's right. Nine times out of ten, something like that would have
gotten us killed.

Thane: I don't believe what I'm hearing. This is the thanks I get for saving
you?

Asra: No, that's not... (Sigh) You did save my life, and I'm grateful for that.
Really, I mean it. But there are better ways you could have handled that.

[Beat]

Thane: I know it was impulsive. I just couldn't... I really want to keep you
safe. Even if I'm bad at it. Sorry.

Asra: You're not bad at it. You probably saved my life a dozen times over
tonight. You just had one lapse of judgment. But please don't do it again.

[Thane nods. There's a pause, then Asra shivers.]

Thane: You cold?

Asra: Mhm. Hold me.

[Asra leans back into Thane's arms.]

## CHAPTER 3: CHALT ##
######################

<button class="collapsible">Cargo Inspection</button>
<div class="content">

[The train slows and comes to a halt.]

Thane: Is this Chalt?

Dagan: Has to be. The Capital Spire is right over there, see?

Asra: You know the city?

Dagan: Chalt was a big tipping point in the Civil War. Conquering it was a huge
feat, and one of the biggest reasons Somoza saw fit to make it the new capital.
Hence the spire.

Asra: Either that or he's compensating for something.

Thane: I don't doubt that. You know what they say about the Debonese.

Asra: Wait, Somoza is Debonese?

Dagan: Somoza's Debonese-Cheminan by blood. He grew up in Nenegi, but he had a
lot of connections back in Debony.

Asra: I had no idea... How did he become so powerful?

Thane: How do you think? He invested in factories and started making guns.

Dagan: You're leaving out a big part of what actually happened. In order to make
those investments, Somoza needed money and support. Most of that support came
from Debony's public sector. Unofficially, of course.

Asra: No way. Did they know they were funding a civil war?

Dagan: Oh yes, and it's exactly what they wanted to happen, too. And it wasn't
just weapons. People that hung around Somoza started getting all kinds of nice
bonuses. That's how he got all the manpower behind his campaign.

Asra: But if Debony is backing Somoza, why do we want to escape there?

Dagan: They used to support him. Back before the war, Debony was anxious to get
its hands on our technology.

Asra: Not much has changed, huh?

Dagan: Exactly. Ever since we discovered electricity, they've been pushing
nonstop for a way to start manufacturing their own goods. Somoza was supposed to
seize control of Chemina, then send all the research and prototypes back home.

Asra: Let me guess. After the war ended, he wanted it all to himself.

Thane: So why didn't Debony just go to war with us?

Dagan: Hard to say. For one, it would be a complete bloodbath. They have a
large enough military to overpower us, but our artillery would make it a very
costly fight. The other reason is it's still in their interest to trade with us.

Asra: What do you mean they could overpower us? Isn't the Cheminan army the
strongest in Kabel?

Dagan: Only if you ask the news.

[A bright light shines in Asra's face. She shrinks back into the shadows.]

Thane: Fuck, what was that?

Dagan: Cargo inspection. Time to go.

Asra: Curfew's still in effect. Where do we go?

Dagan: We'll have to figure that out later. If they're investigating after our
little incident in Gheni, we need to find another way to Nenegi.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Night Patrol Killed</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane unfolds a newspaper and begins to read]

Thane: "Early this morning, officers reported one casualty in Gheni Transit
Center. Forensics confirmed the cause of death to be a gunshot wounds from
Civil War-era weapons."

Dagan: Let me guess. A reward-

Thane: "A reward of up to 1,000 lauves shall be offered to anyone providing
evidence leading to the capture of the suspects Thane Belikoff, Dagan Belikoff,
and Asra Sacco. All three are considered to be armed and dangerous."

Dagan: Perfect, they already know who we are.

Asra: He was hardly the only guy we killed. Why not give the full report?
Wouldn't they want to make us look less sympathetic?

Dagan: You think they'd admit they weren't able to contain the situation? It's
better to make it look like one random act of violence. We're still bad guys
either way.

[Beat]

Asra: Thane... Can I talk to you about something?

Thane: Of course. What is it?

Asra: It's not like the officer in the trainyard was the only person we killed.
I'm a murderer now, too. And... fuck.

Thane: Hey, hey. It's going to get better. I know this is hard. It's hard for me
too.

Asra: It's not hard! That's what scares me.

Thane: ...

Asra: I never wanted to be drafted into the service. I never wanted to be a
medic, either. But I was able to accept it because I could tell myself at least
I was helping people. This is different. It should have felt awful. But it
was... exciting.

Thane: Everyone has their own way of handling extreme situations.

Asra: It's not even about that. It's that I liked it! What does that say about
who I am as a person? What if I just get worse and I lose control? This isn't
who I want to be.

Thane: This is temporary. Once we're in Debony you won't have to do any of this
anymore.

Asra: I'm scared of myself, Thane. Even if we make it, it's not like this will
have never happened.

Thane: I can't promise everything will be fine, but give yourself time. There
will be time to deal with this later. I promise. Just don't force yourself to
figure this all out while it's still happening.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Streetwalker</button>
<div class="content">

[The group walks through the streets of Chalt]

Thane: I can't believe we still haven't gotten you a full uniform that fits.

Dagan: I'm sure they're made in my size. It just isn't common.

Asra: It doesn't help that we aren't targeting soldiers the same size as you.

Dagan: Obviously. It's not like we're trying to pick fights here. We'd be better
off going to a black market.

Asra: Easier said than done. I don't think any of us have connections in Chalt.

Dagan: Actually... That gives me an idea. Stay here.

[Dagan approaches an escort on the corner.]

Dagan: Hey!

Thane: What does he think he's doing?

Escort: Hey there. Anything I can help you with?

Dagan: Yeah. I'm looking to buy a couple things.

Escort: Alright, hun. I know a place where you can get anything you need.

Dagan: I don't need a hotel room. I'm looking for supplies.

Asra: Why is he trying to buy munitions from a hooker?

Thane: (Shrugs) Ask him. I'm as clueless as you are.

Escort: I know someone that can help you.

[The escort begins walking away. Dagan follows, Thane and Asra catching up.]

Dagan: I thought I told you guys to wait. Chalt is dangerous.

Escort: Whoa, what the fuck is this?

Dagan: Keep walking. We're not trying to pick a fight.

[The escort pauses, then continues walking nervously.]

Asra: Okay but seriously, what's this about? Why her?

Dagan: Let's just say crime is a versatile business.

Asra: And she trusts you because...?

Thane: I don't think she trusts us. I think Dagan has a gun.

Asra: But still... Why approach her?

Dagan: Chalt was practically torn to shreds during the Civil War. I spent a lot
of time snapping photos in this area and got to know a lot of locals. Including
the mob.

Thane: Meaning?

Dagan: Gangs in Chalt are well-connected, and there's a strong network for
organized crime. Escorts were always a good entry point for things like drugs
and weapons because they had the most visibility.

Asra: Isn't the job of any prostitute to be a good entry point?

Thane: Nice.

Dagan: The point is, Chalt hasn't changed.

Thane: If you know the city so well, why don't we just find someone you already
know? Wouldn't that be safer?

Dagan: I didn't stay in contact with anyone after the war, and even if I did,
Somoza killed every dissident he could find. Even their kids.

Asra: He killed children just because their parents opposed him!?

Dagan: It's a good strategy. If you're in it for the long haul, the two most
important rules to follow are to educate your young... and kill theirs.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Meeting Malik</button>
<div class="content">

[The escort leads them into an apartment complex. She knocks on a door.]

Merchant: Who is it?

Fayth: Hey Malik, it's Fayth. I've got some people looking for gear.

[The door opens as much as the door chain allows, with a man behind it.]

Malik: What do you need?

Thane: Police uniforms. For him.

[Thane gestures to Dagan.]

Malik: Hmph... Big dude. I'm not sure I've got anything that'll fit him, but
I'll see what I can find. What do you need 'em for, anyway?

Asra: Just playing dress-up.

Malik: Bit old for that, aren't we?

Asra: It's a fetish.

Dagan: Hey-

Malik: Whatever. Not my business. Give me a second.

[Malik closes the door.]

Thane: Is it always hard for you to find clothes?

Dagan: Not always, but it's pretty common. Sure wish it were easier to find
things in my size.

Asra: To be fair, you are pretty big.

Dagan: Not really. It's more that everyone your age grew up malnourished. You
kids grew up with refrigerators and ovens and hardly any food to put in them.

[The door opens again. Behind it, Malik is holding a uniform.]

Malik: This is the largest size I have. Twenty lauves, if you don't mind.

Asra: That's absurd! Fayth, how many blowjobs could I get for that?

Fayth: You specifically? Maybe you should take a health class or something,
because-

Malik: Fayth, please. Do you want these or not?

Dagan: We don't even know if they fit yet.

Malik: If they don't fit, you'll get your money back.

Dagan: ...

Thane: Doesn't leave us much choice, does it?

[Dagan exchanges money for the uniform and changes into it.]

Dagan: A bit tight, but it's better than nothing.

Malik: Is there anything else you three are interested in? I just got some
Ribatol if that tickles your fancy.

Dagan: Ribatol? Isn't that the name of the drug they gave you in the evincer
program?

Thane: Yeah. It's a hallucinogen. What about it?

Asra: Wait, what? Thane...

Thane: What? Quit looking at me like that.

Asra: Sorry. It's just... hallucinogens are concerning.

Thane: Why? Did you have a bad experience or something?

Asra: Not me. A few years back, one of my friends started experimenting with
mushrooms. Something happened. He started having relapses, even after he'd
stopped taking them. The doctor diagnosed him with something. Can't remember
what he called it.

Dagan: That sounds like HPPD - hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. I
don't know much about it except that it usually only happens if you're a really
heavy user.

Thane: I must be lucky then. They gave us a lot of that stuff, but I never
noticed anything unusual after the initial effects wore off.

Asra: Fuck. I can't believe they would take a risk like that. Why would they
want to drug you to begin with?

Thane: Evincing is all about changing your perception to make it reality.
Ribatol is supposed to facilitate that. The goal was to induce hallucinations
that the user could control, and that was supposed to manifest them in reality.

Asra: Whoa. Did it work?

Thane: Honestly, no. Although it was hard to tell. Some people seemed to get
better at evincing when using it, just not me.

Dagan: ...

Asra: I guess I see the logic. Still, it's fucked up that they're using
Cheminan civilians to test stuff like that.

Dagan: My guess would be that they tested it on prisoners of war before using it
on our own people.

Asra: Oh. Well in that case it's fine.

Malik: So... Are you buying anything or not?

[A shop opens.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Squatting</button>
<div class="content">

[The group stands at Malik's door, at the landing of a stairwell.]

Thane: We should find a place to settle down for the night. We can't keep going
around past curfew. We'll get ourselves killed.

Dagan: We could just sleep here.

Thane: I don't even know where this is.

Dagan: We're in the old uptown area. It's not a great neighborhood, and my guess
is it only got worse after the war ended. We should stay put until morning.

Asra: This place seems as good a place as any. Let's try the stairwell. If it
opens to the roof we can probably sleep on the landing without any trouble.

[The three climb just past the top floor.]

Thane: There's a slight breeze here, but it's not bad. You're probably right
that no one is going to come up here.

[Thane lays a blanket out. They huddle together on the landing. Dagan lays down
and closes his eyes.]

Thane: Hey, Asra.

Asra: Yeah?

Thane: You were great today. Doing this all over again right after Gheni, and
not knowing if we'll have to keep doing the same thing tomorrow... I know it's
not fun. But still, you've been amazing.

Asra: Thank you. I... How do you and Dagan do it? How does it not affect you?

Thane: It does affect us. At least, it affects me. If I'm being honest, this is
way worse than the army. Back then I had a captain, a base, some semblance of a
plan...

Asra: That feels like so long ago. I still remember the first time I saw you,
carried in on a stretcher. Just talking about it makes it sound like the opening
to some bad soap opera.

Thane: And the first thing I saw when I came to were those stormy gray eyes. And
then you nursed me back to health and we lived-

Asra: Oh, come on!

Thane: Hey, you were the one that brought up soap operas.

Asra: You call this happily ever after? Man, I'd hate to see what your idea of a
downer ending is.

Thane: Well, this isn't much of an ending at all. We still have to make it to
Debony first. But hey, it could be worse.

Asra: Could be a lot better, too. What if we'd left before those officers tried
to drag you away? We'd already be in Nenegi by now and no one would be after us.

Thane: Well, they'd still be after me. But you and Dagan would be in the clear.

Asra: Ah, right...

Thane: But seriously, think about how shitty it would be to do this alone. Not
to mention borderline suicidal. Having you here makes a world of difference.

[Asra cuddles up to Thane and closes her eyes.]

Asra: Yeah. There's no way I could have survived this without you.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Leaving Chalt</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio wakes up on the stairwell.]

Thane: So, what's the plan for today?

Dagan: That's a damn good question. After the debacle at the trainyard there's
no way we can go back and hitch a ride to Nenegi. Our best bet might be going by
horseback.

Asra: What about a car?

Dagan: How would that work? None of us can drive. Besides, even renting one
would be outside of our price range.

Thane: Horseback should work just fine. Let's head downtown and see what we can
find.

Dagan: I haven't been here in quite some time, but there used to be tons of
stables in old town. We're probably better off looking there first.

Thane: Alright, we can start there. You think anyone in Chalt is going to be
looking for us yet?

Asra: Hard to say. They might still think we're in Gheni.

Dagan: I wouldn't worry too much about it. Even if they know we're here, there's
more than enough crime in Chalt to keep the cops busy.

Asra: Wouldn't Somoza want the capital to be... I don't know, nicer?

Dagan: It's plenty nice by all the government buildings and tourist attractions.
Only the residential districts look like a dump. Which I'm sure suits him just
fine.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Remembrance of the Rega Massacre
</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane opens a newspaper and begins to read]

Thane: "Today marks the one year anniversary of the Rega Massacre, a tragic
event in which 413 civilians and 588 soldiers were killed in an unprovoked
assault on Cheminan territory."

Asra: Hard to believe it's been a year already.

Thane: "General Jaromir reminds our brave soldiers that the enemy is ruthless
and underhanded, and that it is tragedies such as these that demand our troops
remain steadfast in protecting our great nation."

Dagan: Ugh, Jaromir... The sooner that leech dies, the better.

Asra: ... What?

Dagan: You heard me.

Asra: Jaromir's one of the best tacticians we have. Do you know how many of our
soldiers would be dead if it weren't for him?

Dagan: Does it matter? It's one thing to be a strategist. It's another to play
the part of some media rockstar and propagandize the war. I don't understand why
you're getting behind a patriotic narrative like this.

Asra: It's not about patriotism! My parents died that day! I hate war as much as
the next guy, but it's not like we could just call for a ceasefire tomorrow and
Erawa would stop attacking us.

Dagan: I'm not talking about the damned massacre, I'm talking about the article!
Jaromir isn't from Rega; he's from Chalt. He doesn't give a shit about your
parents, he's just using the massacre as an excuse to draw support.

Asra: It IS the anniversary of the massacre. What are they supposed to do, just
pretend it never happened?

Dagan: No. I'm saying it's wrong to stand on the bodies of your parents to
rattle off war propaganda.

Asra: That's pretty rich coming from you. I KNOW you've written stuff way worse
than this.

Dagan: It's not as though I enjoy writing that garbage. You know as well as I do
that you have to toe the party line to make it in this country. I did what I had
to do to support Thane. And you, in case you forgot.

Asra: ...

Thane: Are you two done?

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Trolley</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio approach a stop where passengers are boarding a trolley.]

Soldier: Because our great leader is holding a rally at the square, the only
routes in service today are those running to or from the downtown area!

Dagan: Just what we needed.

Asra: Doesn't cost us more than a bit of time. We can still get horses
afterward.

Thane: At least it's only a rally. Better than a public execution.

Dagan: Hardly.

[The trio board.]

Asra: I'll bet a captive audience does wonders for Somoza's self-esteem.

Thane: Keep your voice down! Are you trying to get us killed?

[The trio boards a trolley and heads toward the square.]

Asra: There might be stables downtown, too. It's worth looking around while
we're there. Might save us some time.

Dagan: Downtown Chalt is the most modernized neighborhood in the country, maybe
the most modern on Kabel. My guess is almost everyone there uses automobiles.
But you're right. It's still worth looking.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Rally</button>
<div class="content">

[Somoza stands at a podium, delivering a speech.]

Farid Somoza: "On this day, one year ago, Cleric Gael Mancini saw fit to send an
army to our homeland, slaughtering hundreds of innocents. This is a travesty of
justice that our people must never forget. But neither shall we forget the
bravery shown by those who laid down their lives to protect their neighbors.

"I consider tragedies such as these to show the inherent difference between us.
In Erawa, I see barbaric acts taken against non-combatants. I see the cowardice
of an enemy that cannot fight with honor. But in our people, I see courage -
the courage to stand against such an enemy, to defend our homeland, and most
importantly, to rebuild and prosper anew amidst the threat we face.

"When I first came to lead Chemina, I was faced with a great deal of opposition.
I saw the looming threat of Erawa, but soft-hearted apologists assured me that
such concerns were unnecessary. Many were blind to the enemy which threatened
to destroy us from within. It is chilling to imagine the scope of destruction we
undoubtedly would have faced had such naivety been the prevailing mentality when
Erawa first invaded. Our children may well be speaking Erawan in school, or
forced to adopt their occult practices.

"Remember, comrades, that Erawa is the antithesis of all that we stand for. They
are a people dependent upon their archaic witchcraft. Their society is one of
stagnation, and for all their history, they have nothing to show for the time
they have had to civilize themselves.

"But, compare their society to ours! Progress and cooperation are Chemina's
foundation, and while the fight ahead of us may be long and arduous, I encourage
you also to look at how far we have come. Why, just within my lifetime, I have
seen the genesis of motor vehicles and aircraft, the proliferation of electrical
power in the form of various appliances, and a country that has become ever more
interconnected thanks to railroads and the telegraph.

"For this reason I have certainty that our triumph over Erawa is inevitable. As
our country marches onward and our technology becomes ever more advanced, they
sit and twiddle their thumbs. Erawa is much the same as it has always been, and
is doomed to remain as such.

"It is also for this reason that I can be confident that we are righteous in
this conflict. For not only have we transformed ourselves, the entirety of Kabel
has been transformed by the fruits of our innovation! We toil not just to
benefit ourselves, but to the benefit of all humanity. Standing before me I do
not see engineers and soldiers, but pioneers of a new age and guardians of the
future."

Thane: Oh, shit.

Asra: What is it?

Thane: On my left. I know that guy. We were squadmates. I have to get out of
here before he recognizes me.

Asra: Do you think he knows the authorities are looking for you?

Dagan: Doesn't matter. We shouldn't risk hanging around here. There's a bar on
the top floor of Knox Tower. We'll be out of sight, plus we can look around to
see if there are any stables downtown while we're up there.

[The trio slink off toward the tower.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Iron Sights</button>
<div class="content">

[The group enter Knox Tower]

Receptionist: Are you here for Knox Bar and Grill? You can take the elevator to
the top floor.

Dagan: We'll take the stairs, thanks.

Receptionist: If you insist.

[The trio enters the stairwell of the Knox Tower and begin climbing.]

Thane: What's that all about?

Dagan: I don't like elevators.

Thane: We're lucky no one questions us in uniform.

Dagan: Luck has nothing to do with it. It's not like we're wearing these on
accident.

Asra: Not to mention we all look fiendishly attractive.

Thane: Wait. This building has sixty floors. Are we really taking the stairs
this whole way?

Dagan: Thane already recognized one person here. No reason to risk bumping into
another familiar face.

Asra: Hey. Do you think Somoza's right about us moving into a new age?

Dagan: I think change is coming. But I also think Somoza's biting off more than
he can chew. If he keeps trying to trade technology like gold and spices it's
going to blow up in his face.

Thane: Why? He's been supreme leader my whole life and I've never seen anything
so much as threaten his rule.

Dagan: It's not about politics, it's about the technology itself. It's taken all
of 40 years to go from steam engines to biplanes. It's great for him in the
short-term, but eventually the market is going to grow until it overtakes him.

Asra: Why would that matter? Somoza controls the market, too.

Dagan: His official position is supreme leader. Dictator or not, the title
weighs him down. He's not in a position to cope with the changes technology is
bringing.

Asra: Are you saying we'll have to compete with another country? You said
yourself Chemina has a lock on technology. 

Dagan: We're already competing with the United Territories. It might be in the
early stages, but our technology is being reverse engineered, and as long as we
keep trading with them, they'll keep catching up. Give it a few years and I
guarantee Somoza's going to start losing his footing.

Thane: You say that like we're just handing over everything we've got. Debony's
still using muskets and we've got machine guns.

Dagan: I'm sure Somoza is thinking the same thing, but that's exactly why his
rule isn't going to last. He's too stubborn, and despite all the resources he's
put into R&D, he treats everything like it's a military operation. Economics are
delicate. Somoza doesn't do delicate.

Asra: So you're saying Debony's just going to leave us in the dust? Even if that
were true, how would that affect Somoza?

Dagan: Think. Not only is the United Territories bigger than us, they're our
biggest trade partner. Once they have what they need they'll stop buying from
us, and they'll probably be able to export goods to other countries cheaper than
we can. Chemina will crumble from the inside out.

Asra: You say that like it's certain, but there are tons of countries that do
just fine without being economic superpowers.

Thane: Dagan's got a point, though. Once Debony stops trading with us, how's
Somoza going to fund the war effort? If we're still at war with Erawa by the
time that happens, they'll completely mow us over.

Dagan: That's surprisingly astute. And optimistic, now that I think about it.

[Thane approaches a window, then waves them over.]

Thane: Hey, come look at this.

[Somoza, still speaking, is visible through the window.]

Dagan: Whoa...

Asra: Holy shit. We could totally hit him from here.

Thane: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. What are the odds?

Asra: One in a million? This doesn't even make sense.

Dagan: I can hardly believe what I'm seeing. This looks too good to be true. Do
we really want to though?

Asra: How can you not want to? It'd be insane to pass up something like this.

Dagan: Thane, listen to me closely. If you shoot him, all of us will die. I'm
not saying it's wrong, but you need to understand that.

<div class="content">

[Asra and Thane watch Somoza's speech from afar]

Asra: He started the war that killed my parents. He sent both of yours away to
die. He shouldn't be alive. Not after everything he's done.

Thane: You realize there's no way we could get away with this, right?

Asra: This is going to sound impulsive, but I don't care. We're just three
people, Thane. What are our lives worth compared to the millions that are
suffering because of him? This is bigger than just us.

Thane: Now you're starting to sound like the revolutionary. I didn't think you
would be so eager to do this.

Asra: My family might have been misinformed but we weren't naive. I was taught
in school to love Somoza, but we were also afraid. There's only so much you can
fear someone before you start to resent them. I want him dead.

Thane: So do I, but I also want to make it out of this country alive. I want to
have a future with you. Isn't that what you wanted, too?

Asra: What if someone else had the same chance to kill him, but didn't? What if
they said the same thing you did? I want to escape with you, Thane. So, so
badly. But we can't take an opportunity like this and do nothing with it.

Thane: Weren't you just saying you were afraid of how bloodthirsty you were
becoming? Are you sure this is what you want?

Asra: This is different. I'm not the one holding the gun. And I've wanted Somoza
dead long before we decided we wanted to go to Debony.

Thane: But... Would you really rather have your vengeance than make it over the
border? Aren't you more important than that? Aren't I?

Asra: I don't want to bully you into getting yourself killed based on my whim.
If I were a good enough shot I'd shoot him myself and take full responsibility,
but I'm not. And it's not right for me to make the decision for all of us.

Thane: You didn't answer my question. Does killing him mean that much to you?

Asra: I... don't know. I do love you. But what if we don't shoot him and we
still get caught trying to flee? What if we pass up this chance and it's all for
nothing?

Thane: What if I shoot and miss? There's always a chance something could go
wrong.

Asra: From here? You won't miss.

Thane: ... Yeah, you're right. I won't.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Dagan: Assassination</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan watch Somoza's speech from afar]

Dagan: I'd think twice before pulling that trigger. You know his son is just
going to take over, right? Besides, his regime is doomed to fall even without
our help.

Thane: Yeah, but-

Dagan: But what? What's done is done. You can't bring back the people that are
already dead, and killing Somoza now isn't going to help anyone either. Changing
the world is more complicated than shooting bad guys.

Thane: He still deserves to die.

Dagan: Sure he does. But are you going to throw all of our lives away based on
who deserves what?

Thane: Are you telling me not to shoot him?

Dagan: ... No. I don't ever want to tell someone the story about how my nephew
almost killed Farid Somoza until I talked him out of it. I could never live with
myself.

Thane: What do you want, then?

Dagan: I'm staying neutral.

Thane: You haven't changed at all since the Civil War, have you? Can't pick a
side, even when the whole country is at stake. 

Dagan: The country isn't at stake. Your choice here ultimately changes nothing.

Thane: And I'm somehow supposed to believe you're NOT trying to convince me to
walk away? Is this your idea of integrity?

Dagan: My integrity went out the window the day your mother was taken away.

Thane: ...

Dagan: Pledging loyalty to Somoza... I did that out of self-preservation. This
is different. I'm letting you make this choice yourself, even if it kills me.

Thane: You're putting your life in my hands that easily? Is this important to
you or not?

Dagan: This is extremely important to me, but both choices have merit. That's
why I'm not trying to sway you either way. Just so long as you understand the
consequences.

<button class="collapsible">Shooting Somoza</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane shoots Somoza. Below, the crowd erupts into chaos.]

Dagan: Well, it was nice knowing you guys.

[Above, a door is flung open and footsteps are heard descending the stairs.]

Asra: Move!

Thane: (Not much point in running, but it's better than standing around until
we get arrested or shot.)

[The trio flees the tower to the street. Above, a blimp floats into view.]

Dagan: Shit.

Asra: If this is where I die, I'm not going down without a fight. Come on,
Thane!

Dagan: Just run! Guns won't do anything against that airship!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Sparing Somoza</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane lowers his gun.]

Thane: Sorry, Asra. I love you too much. I can't put you in danger. Not when
we've come so far. Besides, Dagan is right. Literally nothing would change about
Chemina if I shot him now.

Asra: That... wasn't my preference.

Thane: Honestly, I don't care. I'm just too selfish. Come on, I think I saw
stables on the other end of the plaza.

Asra: ...

Thane: You still want to escape with me, right? This is how we're going to make
that happen.

[The trio make their way back to the street and make their way to the stables.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Spare: Meltdown</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio approach the stables.]

Dagan: Hey. We're looking to rent three horses for the day.

Thane: Make it two. I don't know how to ride.

Dagan: You sure this is gonna work?

Asra: It shouldn't be a problem. Thane and I can ride double.

Stablehand: Two, then?

Dagan: Yeah, two's fine.

Stablehand: You said just for the day, right? That's five lauves, and I'll be
holding onto an additional 25 as collateral.

Thane: Ouch.

Dagan: I'll have a look at the horses, if you don't mind.

Stablehand: Of course.

[Dagan examines the horses for a moment, then reaches into his pocket, hands
over the money, and signs with a fake name.]

Asra: I didn't know you carried that kind of cash around.

Dagan: Saito and I put aside savings in case we ever had to fund a little
adventure like this. Most people aren't so lucky.

Asra: Hold on. You say Thane is malnourished, but you've been stashing away
money this whole time?

Dagan: Asra, please. Saving for long-term contingencies isn't mutually exclusive
with taking care of day-to-day expenses. What kind of person do you think I am?

[Dagan mounts his horse, then Asra, and Thane behind her.]

Stablehand: I'll need these back by sundown tomorrow.

Dagan: Acknowledged.

[The trio begin riding down the street.]

Asra: Poor bastard.

Thane: Can't be helped. At least he'll get to keep the money.

Asra: These horses are probably worth double what he took as collateral. But
you're right. There's no way he's getting them back.

Thane: Shit, there he is again.

[Thane presses himself against Asra and looks the other way.]

Asra: The guy that knows you?

Thane: Yeah. His name is Ludo.

Asra: He's coming toward us. Keep facing the other way.

Ludo: Get down!! Those are the criminals from Gheni!

[Ludo draws his weapon and aims it in the direction of the trio. A few soldiers
draw their own guns, while civilians scatter.]

Dagan: Run!

[Thane pulls out a pistol and fires toward Ludo. He misses, but Ludo dives for
cover. Asra and Dagan pick up speed. Shots ring behind them.]

Asra: Damn it, Thane! I knew it! I fucking knew it! We should have shot him when
we had the chance!

Thane: Save it for later. We need to get out of here!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Armored Car</button>
<div class="content">

[An armored car with a mounted turret rolls onto the street and fires at them.
The horses are hit, sending the trio sprawling onto the street. They scatter
for cover.]

Thane: Fuck. This... There's no way. This is impossible.

Asra: Come on, Thane! Smoke the turret and flank the gunner. We can do this! I
won't let you die here, so quit moping and fucking move!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Shoot: Blimp Down</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio get into the armored car, still being shot at by the blimp.]

Asra: Thane, the turret!

Thane: What?

Asra: It's using incendiary rounds! Use it on the blimp!

[Thane climbs on top of the car and fires at the blimp, which erupts in flames
instantly.]

Thane: What the-?

Asra: Yeah!! Eat that, bitch!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Roadtrip</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra starts driving away, bullets glancing off the rear of the vehicle.]

Thane: I thought you couldn't drive?

Asra: Shh, don't jinx it.

Dagan: I have no idea how we did that.

Asra: Yeah, that was... something else. How are you holding up, Thane?

Thane: I... Thank you.

Asra: Huh? For what?

Thane: For making me get my shit together. I really thought we were going to die
back there. Thank you.

Asra: What was I supposed to do, tell you to lie down and die? I might have
wanted Somoza dead, I still do want to escape with you. I love you and I'm not
letting anyone take you away from me.

Thane: Escape...? We're not just a couple criminals running from city to city.
They're going to see us as domestic terrorists. It doesn't matter where we
drive, we'll be shot on sight.

Asra: We ditch the Vollmer when we reach Nenegi and hope that no one there has
seen our faces on a wanted poster yet.

Thane: What's the point? Escaping at this point is impossible.

Dagan: We lose nothing by trying.

Asra: Dagan's right. Come on, Thane. Where's all this coming from?

Thane: What do you think!? Did you see what happened back there? Like, can we
talk about what that means for a second?

Dagan: Fine. The whole country is after us now. We're probably going to die. Is
that what you wanted to hear?

[Asra takes Thane's hand in hers and squeezes, her other hand still on the
wheel.]

Asra: Thane. I want to get out of this country, but I can't do it on my own. I
need you. Please, help me. I don't want to die here.

Thane: (Whispering) Okay.

## CHAPTER 4: NENEGI ##
#######################

<button class="collapsible">Waylaid</button>
<div class="content">

[Dagan, Asra, and Thane ride past trees and smokestacks in the Vollmer Armored
Car.]

Thane: I always wanted to see your hometown. Never imagined it would be like
this.

Asra: Really? I always dreamed of taking you back with me in a three-ton
Vollmer.

Thane: You know what I mean. I wish I'd gotten to know your parents.

Asra: Stop romanticizing it like that, Thane. I already told you they were
small-minded. If they'd known I was seeing some half-Erawan guy...

Thane: Well, what if they didn't know? Do you think we would have gotten along?

Asra: I don't know. It's not like I got along with them so well myself. They
probably would have been nice to you, but I doubt you would have had much to
connect over. Hey, random question.

Thane: Yeah?

Asra: Do you think you'll be able to do any evincing in Nenegi?

Thane: That's a really good question. Nenegi is pretty close to the Erawan
border. I might be able to do something simple. Control a coin flip, maybe.

Asra: Is that what you learned to do before?

Thane: It was one of the things. Just about everything I learned was really easy
stuff, and probably not that useful.

Asra: Who taught you? Was it your mom, or the guys in the evincer program?

Thane: Mom never talked much about evincing. Gheni was way too far from the
Fracture for her to do stuff, so she couldn't have taught me if she'd wanted to.
She did talk about the spiritual aspect, though.

Asra: So the training was different?

Thane: Definitely. It was secular, of course. There were only twenty of us, and
the whole thing was supposed to be under wraps. Mostly they just gave us the
enhancements and started us off by showing us optical illusions.

Asra: Why would that do anything?

Thane: Evincing is more than just willing things to happen. You have to believe
they're already happening. So for instance, if you see a pencil in a glass of
water and it looks broken because of refraction, you can snap it in half for
real.

Asra: That's crazy!

Thane: Yeah. We also rigged dice a lot.

Asra: Why dice? That sounds weirdly specific and kind of pointless.

Thane: Evincing is kind of like a glorified placebo effect. Stuff that's based
on luck is easy because you can imagine it happening, even if it's unlikely. The
point is to skew the odds in your favor.

Asra: But this was still a military program, right? Did you ever use that spar
with each other?

Thane: Eventually, yeah. Fighting is way harder because you can use your own
perception to suppress the other person's abilities. Most of the time you just
cancel each other out. I was never great at it. That, and there was the whole
medical discharge thing, so I never finished the program.

Asra: Yeah, what was that about? You've never explained why that happened.

Thane: That's because I don't understand it myself. They kept saying I was sick,
but I felt totally fine. They wouldn't even wait for me to recover.

Asra: That's really bizarre. I've never heard of something like that happening.
Half the time they don't care how battered or bruised you are. As far as they're
concerned, you're meat.

Thane: One more thing to look forward to in Debony, I suppose.

Dagan: I wouldn't be so sure about that.

Asra: What do you mean?

Dagan: You didn't think Debony would take you in out of the good of their
hearts, did you? Both of you are engineers. I guarantee they're gonna milk every
trade secret out of you and then some.

Asra: You make it sound like it's not worth trying to escape at all.

Dagan: I never said that. Debony won't force you to fight, they won't care that
Thane's half-Erawan, and you'll be compensated far better than you are here.
That's gotta count for something, right?

[Asra points into the distance.]

Asra: We're coming up on Nenegi. If we get too close in the Vollmer, someone's
bound to see us. We should ditch this thing and keep going on foot.

Thane: (And to think I almost forgot how fucked we are.)

Dagan: No doubt there's a patrol waiting to cut us off when we get there. They
saw us headed for Nenegi when we made it outside city limits.

Asra: Nenegi is surrounded by rocky terrain. It's one of the reasons it's a
military town, since it's naturally fortified. There are only two main roads
into the city, and they're going to have tight security regardless.

Dagan: You said main roads. So does that mean-

Asra: Yes. I took the liberty of driving through some of the rockier terrain.
There are some less direct routes into the city through here. Mostly gangs use
them to smuggle in contraband.

Dagan: And border security doesn't know about it?

Asra: They don't care. Troops trade on the black market at least as much as any
of the civilians, so they're happy to turn a blind eye.

Thane: That's not exactly reassuring. You think a smuggler would pass up the
bounty on our heads?

Asra: Well, if it does come down to that, we can expect more of the same.
Running, hiding, killing. Not saying I'm looking forward to it, but it's nothing
we haven't already done.

[Asra parks the Vollmer and motions for the others to get out.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Invention of Television</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane picks up a newspaper and begins to read]

Thane: "Researchers use amplitude-modulated frequencies to transmit images via
cathode ray tubes. Visual broadcast media is expected to reach the market later
this year."

Dagan: I didn't understand half of that.

Asra: I'm surprised. Aren't you the one that's always saying education is worse
than it used to be?

Thane: (Not this again...)

Dagan: It is. People used to know history. They used to know how to think. Now
it's a mad rush to find the next science prodigy.

Asra: That's not fair. Who are you to decide what people should be learning? I
don't see you inventing anything.

Thane: Asra, don't-

Dagan: It's not about what I've invented, or what anyone's invented for that
matter. You two grow up practically illiterate and completely ignorant of your
own history, and then you think engineering is the only thing worth knowing.

Asra: Not everyone has to be like you, Dagan! Different people-

Dagan: Everyone needs to know why things are the way they are right now! You
can't raise a whole generation of engineers to be subservient workers that shirk
their collective responsibility as citizens and then complain about oppression.

Asra: What do you know about collective responsibility? Your own brother risked
his life in the Civil War and all you did was stand on the sidelines and watch!

Dagan: You'd know all about that, wouldn't you? Please, keep lecturing me about
a war you weren't even alive to witness.

Thane: Both of you shut up!

Asra: ...

Thane: You can argue as much as you want when we reach Debony, but until then,
put the drama aside and stay focused.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Passing Through Nenegi</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra leads the group through the city.]

Thane: How close are we to your old house?

Asra: Not very. We came in through the northwest side of the city and we're
headed due south. Our house was southeast by all the industrial factories.

Dagan: So much the better. I'll bet it's crawling with cops by now.

Thane: You really think so? It's been almost a year since Asra lived there.

Dagan: Better safe than sorry.

Asra: Honestly, we'd probably be safer if we were farther east. The military
base stretches all along the west border.

Thane: We could just go around and approach from the east.

Asra: Not worth the trouble. They're about to turn this city upside down looking
for us. We want to be out of here before that happens.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Meeting Vanna</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra leads the group to an apartment.]

Thane: Who is this Vanna, anyway?

Asra: She was my parents' supplier here in Nenegi.

Thane: I didn't realize you had those kinds of connections.

Asra: What do you mean? Everyone has a supplier somewhere or other. My dad
wasn't a revolutionary but it's not like we were model citizens. I've known
Vanna since I was eleven.

Dagan: Hold on, how did your parents die in the Rega Massacre if you lived in
Nenegi?

Asra: They commuted to Rega every day for work. Dad got carried away with all
the fear mongering and insisted we live in Nenegi. Said it'd be safer.

Thane: Sounds like he was right.

Asra: Yeah. I was at home during the attack.

Thane: Did Vanna give you any help you after your parents passed?

Asra: I didn't really think to ask. When you offered for me to move in, all I
really had to do was pack my things and get a train ticket. But if you hadn't
been there, she's the next person I would have asked.

Dagan: So you're sure we can trust her?

Asra: She owes me a huge favor. I don't see her turning us down.

Dagan: I hope you know what you're doing. We're putting a lot of trust in her by
showing our faces.

Asra: Vanna was in Rega during the attack. Overseeing some shipments, I think.
Once the fighting started she tried to flee but she almost got blown up by a 
flat bomb. My mom saved her life, right before she died trying to save Dad.

[Asra knocks, and a woman opens the door, a pistol at each hip.]

Vanna: Asra. Didn't think I'd see you again. And you brought company, too.

Asra: Hey, Vanna. This is my partner Thane and his uncle Dagan. We need some
help.

Vanna: Could have guessed that one. Come in. The weapons stay by the door.

[Vanna waves the group inside, and after Asra nods, Thane and Dagan set their
guns down.]

Vanna: You scared the shit out of me showing up in those uniforms. I thought I
was getting raided until I recognized you. Speaking of which... I haven't seen
you in, what, a year? Where have you been?

Asra: I've been in Gheni since the Massacre.

Vanna: Makes sense. So, what do you need?

Asra: Yeah. We're trying to get to the United Territories.

Vanna: Oh, fuck off. It's never the easy stuff with you, is it?

Asra: Does that mean you can't help us?

Vanna: (Sighs) I've got some friends that can help you. But right now it's past
curfew. Stay here for the night. I'll give you directions in the morning.

Thane: Thank you so much.

Asra: We actually made arrangements to stay with a friend. Would we be able to
use your telegraph to tell them we're not coming?

[Beat]

Vanna: I was taking care of some business in the study when you knocked. Give me
a few minutes to finish up first.

Asra: Of course. Take your time.

[Vanna enters her study and locks it behind her]

Dagan: What was that about?

Asra: (Whispers) Something's wrong. I think someone's here.

Thane: What? How do you know?

[Asra quietly walks to the door and picks up her gun. Thane and Dagan do the
same, exchanging concerned looks.]

Asra: Vanna doesn't dress like that unless she's meeting with some high-ranking
official. And I'm pretty sure only one of the guns she was carrying was hers;
she hates Pfangers.

Thane: Why does it matter that she's got someone else's gun?

Asra: We left our weapons at the door, remember? If Vanna didn't want us to know
she had a guest, she'd carry them both. Also, she asked where we'd been. So
she's pretending she doesn't know we're on the run.

Dagan: Pretending? The fiasco in Chalt just happened. I'm sure some people are
on the lookout for us, but someone that's not paying attention would honestly
have no idea we're here.

Asra: Vanna's always paying attention. She's constantly exchanging telegraphs
and staying up to date. There's no way she doesn't know about Chalt.

Thane: So what does that mean?

Asra: If someone else is here and she wants us to have our guard down? I'd guess
she's planning on turning us in.

Dagan: You said we could trust her. If you thought this was going to happen,
what the fuck are we doing here?

Asra: I wasn't expecting this!

Thane: Is there any chance these are false positives? Any other reason Vanna
would carry a gun she doesn't like, or the other stuff you mentioned? Or a good
reason for her to sell us out?

Asra: Maybe some really contrived reason? The most straightforward explanation
that I can think of is some higher-up would pressure her to turn us in.

Dagan: So why don't we just leave?

Asra: I'd rather be sure something's wrong before we subject ourselves to
another night of sneaking around after curfew.

Dagan: By the time we're sure it might be too late.

Thane: It might be too late already. The telegraph is in her study, right? They
might be calling for help right now.

Asra: If Vanna's trying to turn us in, she won't want us to leave. One of us
can open the front door while someone else stays inside and hides. When she
investigates, we can check the study to see if anyone is hiding there.

Dagan: And if the study really is empty?

Asra: (Shrugs) Then we come up with some lame excuse and have an awkward
situation.

Thane: Alright.

[Asra walks to the front door. Thane walks down the hall past the door to the
study. Asra opens the door; she and Dagan hide behind the doorway.]

[Vanna and officer run out, Thane tails officer. Dagan and Asra confront Vanna
head-on. Thane holds officer at gunpoint. Vanna incapacitates Dagan and Asra,
prompting Thane to shoot the officer. Vanna then holds Dagan and Asra at
gunpoint with each pistol.]

Asra: Ungrateful bitch. Your corpse should be rotting in Rega right now.

Vanna: This... This wasn't what I wanted! You just had to come at the worst
fucking time, didn't you?

[Asra glances at the officer.]

Asra: What, because of him? What's he going to do about it now? This is stupid.
Just let us leave. I'm begging you, Vanna. It doesn't have to be like this.

Vanna: It's too late to turn back. He just called in three units, and I will not
let it be known that I was complicit in-

[Thane empties several rounds into Vanna's chest. Vanna's guns fire wildly,
missing Dagan but hitting Asra in the arm.]

Dagan: Shit!

Thane: Asra! Are you okay?

Asra: Yeah, I'm... Fuck... Vanna... Thane... What the fuck!?

Thane: We're running out of time. Let me get you patched up.

[Asra looks at Vanna's corpse as Thane patches the wound.]

Asra: ... Vanna?

Dagan: You heard her. We need to move, now.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Capture</button>
<div class="content">

[A grenade explodes, throwing Asra to the ground, unconscious. As Thane kneels
next to her, gunshots erupt, forcing him and Dagan to flee to cover. An officer
rushes to grab her body.]

Thane: No!!

[Thane fires at the officer, forcing him back behind cover. A grenade is thrown
at Thane and Dagan. When the dust clears, two people are already dragging Asra
away.]

Thane: Asra!!

[Several officers start advancing on them. Thane fires at them.]

Dagan: We can't stay here!

Thane: We have to! 

Dagan: There's nothing we can do!

Thane: (This isn't happening. This can't be happening.)

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Regroup</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan come across a river.]

Dagan: Quick, into the water!

[They dive in and are swept away almost instantly. Eventually, they crawl up
onto the riverbank.]

Thane: What the fuck do we do now?

Dagan: Well... We need to get out of these clothes before hypothermia sets in.
I'd make a fire but we can't risk being caught.

Thane: (We have to go back. I can't leave her.)

[Thane and Dagan strip naked and wring out their clothes.]

Thane: There's a cave by that hill. Maybe we can spend the night in there?

Dagan: If anything's living in there, we're fucked.

Thane: If we stay out here, we're fucked.

Dagan: Fair enough.

[Thane and Dagan hang their clothes on branches, then get into the cave, which
is empty.]

Thane: It's fucking freezing in here.

Dagan: Can't be helped. We can either stay up all night or huddle together.

Thane: (I miss her already.)

[Thane cozies up to Dagan awkwardly.]

Thane: So what happens now?

Dagan: Didn't you say Asra's parents had planned to stow away once? We might be
able to do that.

Thane: I'm talking about Asra, you fuck.

Dagan: Are you asking me to tell you what you already know? There's nothing we
can do for her. She'll be interrogated, then executed. Our best bet is to head
for Rega.

Thane: I can't do that.

Dagan: You have to.

Thane: Then go without me.

Dagan: Thane, wake up! You're not some kind of superhero! Asra's probably in the
Nenegi Corrections Facility by now. Name one good plan for saving her.

Thane: ...

Dagan: Asra's parents wanted to be stowaways. What was their plan?

Thane: Supposedly the ships that run between Chemina and the United Territories
stay too close to the arctic circle for tropical barnacles to get stuck on them,
so that's how you know where you're going.

Dagan: Assuming you can get on the ship. Still, it's a start.

Thane: Does it matter whether or not we go to Debony?

Dagan: Distance is the key factor here. Every country in Kabel wants to get
their hands on Cheminan engineers. We can expect political asylum pretty much
anywhere, but the important part is getting there in one piece.

Thane: That's not what I meant.

Dagan: I know things look shitty now, but you can't let that distract you from
the fact that it really will be better there. I don't use this word often, but
try to have a little faith. At the very least, it's better than doing nothing.

Thane: What about Asra? How's anything going to be better without her?

Dagan: (Sigh) Asra is gone. If you can't accept that, neither of us are going to
be able to make it out of here.

Thane: Does that even matter anymore?

Dagan: Fine. You don't have to be reasonable right now. We can talk in the
morning.

Thane: Fuck... Fuck!

Dagan: If I had a choice, I'd give you some time to grieve, but we're really up
against a wall here. We should really get some sleep.

Thane: (I hope you're okay, wherever you are.)

<button class="collapsible">Deus Ex Machina</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane is running through a forest in the dark. His leg is bleeding, and
unseen pursuers draw closer. One of the pursuers opens fire, shooting him in
the back. Thane collapses. As he rolls over, he sees a soldier loom over him,
face obscured by a visor. They point their gun at him and fire.]

[Thane wakes with a start, naked and cold, to the sound of a civil defense siren
in the distance. Dagan is already awake.]

Dagan: Something's happening. We should take a look.

[There are explosions in the distance.]

Thane: This doesn't have anything to do with us, does it? Wait, what the...?
Those sound like flat bombs.

Dagan: An Erawan attack in Nenegi? That's unheard of.

[Thane picks up his clothes and puts them on.]

Thane: Mostly dry. Let's go see what's going on.

[Dagan gets dressed and they hike toward the noise. A massive walled city can be
seen in the distance, with armored vehicles swarming the perimeter.]

Dagan: Erawa's raiding the prison... No doubt trying to get their men back.

Thane: Is Asra in the middle of all that?

Dagan: I know I'm going to regret saying this, but... If you want to look for
her, this is as good a chance as we're ever going to get. Honestly, between
this and catching Somoza with his pants down, we've had more than our share of
freak coincidences.

Thane: We? You're offering to help?

Dagan: I know what she means to you. I know you won't forgive yourself if you
pass an opportunity like this.

Thane: You're not gonna tell me that my life is more important? Or that yours
is?

Dagan: You'd do this whether or not I came with, right?

Thane: Well, yeah.

Dagan: Neither of us are going to survive if we try to split up. So I'm sticking
with you. Besides, this is the only chance we're going to get. It's now or
never.

Thane: I... really appreciate that.

Dagan: Now that said, our chances of finding her are pretty dismal. We'll be
looking for a needle in a haystack, and even then she might not be here at all.

Thane: A small chance is better than no chance at all.

Dagan: I figured you'd say something like that. Just don't get too hopeful. If
things start to look bad, I'm going to run and escape with my life. I advise you
do the same.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Shoot: KNEW: Risto Somoza's Succesion
</button><div class="content">

[Thane picks up a newspaper.]

Dagan: This should be interesting. How do you think Somoza died? Random heart
attack? Rescuing orphans from a burning building?

Thane: (I really don't want to think about this right now.)

Thane: "The great leader Farid Somoza was shot by Erawan radicals while
delivering a speech in Chalt. He was rushed to the Cheminan Medical Center and
later pronounced dead. The primary suspect has been identified as Thane
Belikoff, an Erawan nationalist born to illegal alien and terrorist Phaedra
Stutz, who raised Belikoff with the intent of destabilizing our sovereign
nation from within."

Dagan: That's actually more clever than I expected. Good for them.

Thane: (Sigh) Wasn't sending Mom to the death camps enough? Did they have to
desecrate her memory, too?

Dagan: The ironic part is you actually were raised by a terrorist. They just
picked the wrong one.

Thane: "This morning, Risto Somoza was inaugurated in his father's place as the
new supreme leader. Thousands cheered as the lieutenant general was sworn in."

[Beat]

Thane: ... It really didn't matter, did it?

Dagan: Well, he is dead. If that's what you wanted, I suppose you have something
to be happy about.

Thane: But the war isn't over. People are still going to die. And Chemina's
still ruled under the same regime.

Dagan: If peace were as easy as killing the bad guy, it would have happened a
long time ago. I did tell you this would happen, didn't I?

Thane: Do you still think I shouldn't have done it?

Dagan: I never thought it was the wrong decision. Somoza deserved to die, I
just thought it would be suicide to kill him. "Miracle" isn't a strong enough
word to describe us getting out of there in one piece.

Thane: What do you mean, miracle? What about Asra!?

Dagan: Calm down. Asra was captured because Vanna set us up. We still got out of
Chalt safely.

Thane: I never really thought about that.

Dagan: Thane, has it really not hit you yet? Farid Somoza is responsible for the
deaths of millions of people, including both of your parents, and Asra's, too.
You killed him and lived to tell the tale. I don't know how much longer we'll be
able to keep ourselves alive, but you might as well pat yourself on the back
while you still can.

Thane: I... did this.

Dagan: Damn right you did.

Thane: (Sigh) Let's go find Asra.

Dagan: I hope you're not planning on making these suicide missions a habit.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">The Camps</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan approach the prison. A massive hole has been torn through one
of the walls. Further west, everything appears to be distorted.]

Dagan: What the fuck is that?

Thane: What the...? They pinched the whole city?

Dagan: Pinched?

Thane: It's an evincing technique that bends physical space to bring two
locations closer. Basically a temporary shortcut for advancing and retreating
quickly.

Dagan: Sounds like they went all in on this attack.

[Thane and Dagan get closer to the prison. They take cover behind a nearby
building.]

Dagan: There's something uncomfortably familiar about all this. Reminds me of
the Civil War.

Thane: (Where would Asra be? Would they lump her in with domestic terrorists?)

Dagan: Not the fighting itself, more just being a correspondent. Standing in the
middle of all the action without fighting on either side.

Thane: (Maybe they'll be too preoccupied with each other to notice us.)

[Thane and Dagan make their way into the prison, blending parallel with several
Cheminan soldiers. Inside, gunshots and explosions can be heard. The inside of
the compound is massive; less of a prison than a town with walls.]

Thane: This... is gigantic. Did you know about this?

Dagan: I knew about the camps, but this is...

[Skeletally thin prisoners cower as soldiers trade fire.]

Thane: It's not a prison. It's a walled city. How are we ever going to find
Asra in all of this? I feel like throwing up. This is too much.

Dagan: You sure you want to do this?

Thane: I'd die before I left her in a place like this.

Dagan: Right. We should make for one of the watchtowers first so we at least
know where we are.

Thane: Wait, is that...?

[Thane turns to an Erawan, then begins sprinting toward her.]

Thane: Mom!!

Dagan: What...

[Dagan chases after Thane, looking around to see if anyone is about to open
fire on them. Thane grabs the woman.]

Thane: Mom! It's me. It's your son. Mom!

[Dagan grabs Thane's face and forces him to make eye contact.]

Dagan: Thane, that's not Phaedra.

Thane: What are you-

Dagan: That's. Not. Your. Mother.

Thane: But she's right...

[Thane turns back to the shaken woman, realizing she's a complete stranger.]

Thane: I...

Dagan: What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you trying to get us killed?

Thane: ...

Dagan: I don't know what's happening to you right now, but if you can't
function, we're leaving. This is dangerous enough without you losing your mind.

[Thane blinks hard.]

Thane: No. I can do this. I have to.

Dagan: What's our first objective?

Thane: We're getting inside one of those watchtowers to get an idea of where we
are and where we should start looking.

Dagan: Alright, then. Let's go.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Mapping the Prison</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan make it up the watchtower.]

Thane: This is horrible.

Dagan: I was expecting this place to look smaller from a bird's eye view. This
is worse than anything I could have imagined.

Thane: ... And Mom died in a place like this.

Dagan: ... Yes, she did.

Thane: Looks like there's a pretty good distribution of buildings here. Offices,
factories, prison blocks, warehouses... That small building just below us looks
like it could contain prisoners. Might be a good place to start.

Dagan: All four of those buildings look like they could be living quarters. We
could hit them one after the other. If we don't find Asra by then... Well, we
can cross that bridge when we come to it.

Thane: Please be safe, wherever you are. We're coming.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">The Erawan Private</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan walk through a prison block.]

Dagan: Sensory Deprivation Block? What's that?

Thane: They explained these when I was in training. It's how evincers are
prevented from using their powers to escape.

Dagan: So there's a prisoner in here?

[Dagan approaches a tank and slides open a porthole.]

Thane: Hey, don't-

[The porthole glows with white light, then begins to rock back and forth
violently before different components are thrown across the room with an
ear-splitting sound.]

Dagan: Holy shit!

Thane: Dagan! Are you alright?

Dagan: My ears are ringing, but I'm fine. What just happened?

Thane: That tank keeps prisoners from using their powers to escape. They block
all stimuli.

Dagan: Wait, you mean...

[The dust clears, revealing an Erawan man. He looks toward Dagan, then staggers
to a piece of debris and picks it up, shrinking it in preparation.]

Prisoner: Cheminan!

Thane: Wait! We're not military!

Prisoner: You expect me to believe that?

Thane: (in Erawan) My mother was Erawan.

Prisoner: Then who are you?

Thane: I'm Thane. This is Dagan. We're trying to rescue someone.

[The man appears to calm himself down.]

Peleg: I'm Peleg, Private of Erawa's 3rd Battalion. Thane... You are looking for
your mother?

Thane: No, someone else. My mother is... gone.

Peleg: There is someone here I must find as well. Finding her is my first
priority. I know this prison well. If you protect me, I can guide you.

Thane: Really? That's... thank you, so much.

Peleg: But just to be sure... If I'm killed or knocked unconscious, this will
kill both of you.

[Peleg waves his flatbomb before tucking it under his clothes.]

Dagan: Erawan soldiers are storming the prison right now. This place is a
warzone. One stray bullet could hit you and we'd all be toast. Fuck that.

Peleg: I have no reason to trust you. That is my offer. Take it or leave it.

Dagan: What a shitty offer.

Thane: We don't know where we're going. He does.

Dagan: ... Fine.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Pronsi</button>
<div class="content">

[Peleg surveys the battleground that is the prison town, then points into the
distance.]

Peleg: There's a warehouse full of Pronsi just north of here. We should grab
some while all the guards are busy fighting.

Dagan: Pronsi?

Peleg: You don't know? It's a stimulant designed to kill from withdrawal. Here
in the prison it's used as a sort of currency to keep people under control.

Thane: Currency? You mean if you don't work they'll just let you keel over and
die?

Dagan: You just described Somoza's regime in one sentence.

Peleg: Its primary use is actually overseas. The Debony uses it on slave miners
in Lamenir.

Dagan: I take it you want enough to survive after you escape?

Peleg: No, not for me. For a cellmate I had, back when I was first captured.
When I was first captured I had a broken arm and couldn't work. She gave me half
of the Pronsi she earned until I healed.

Thane: Wait, but if you're not taking any for yourself, does that mean you're
just gonna let the drug kill you?

Peleg: It depends on how much is in that warehouse. But it kills everyone
eventually. The best you can ever do is buy yourself some time, and in this
case, ration it between three people.

Thane: Three?

Peleg: Your friend will need some too.

Thane: Asra? I... Oh no. She was only captured yesterday. Maybe there's still
time?

Dagan: They're probably planning to execute her. If that's the case, I doubt
they'd bother with something like that.

Peleg: Yesterday? It's an incredible stroke of luck that you were able to make
it here so soon.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Common Ground</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: For being Erawan, you know a lot about our country.

Peleg: I should hope so. I spent a year abroad studying history at the
University of Gheni.

Thane: Wait, that's where I'm from! I studied engineering there, too!

Peleg: 

Thane: So how did you end up here?

Peleg: Well, my main field of study was foreign relations. I was interested in
opening trade routes with Chemina. The Divine Ministry didn't like that, so they
stuck me on the battlefield instead.

Thane: That's kind of similar to what happened to my dad. They forced him to
fight, and then... Well, they say he died, but there's no way to know what
really happened.

Dagan: That whole mentality, putting your political opponents on the front
lines... That was a big reason Phaedra came here. Thanks to Somoza it didn't
make a damn bit of difference.

<button class="collapsible">Anomalies</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane, Dagan, and Peleg are walking through Nenegi Corrections Facility]

Dagan: I didn't realize you spoke Erawan so well.

Thane: I don't. I hardly remember anything my mom taught me. What's really
bizarre is how strong this guy is. Normally you'd have to be in the introsphere
to do that kind of stuff, but we're not even past the Erawan border right now.

Dagan: Do you think he's just that good?

Thane: I fought a lot of evincers when I was deployed in Tripsi. A lot of them
were good. None of them were anything like this.

Dagan: How do you think his abilities reached this point?

Thane: (in Erawan) Peleg, have you always been this strong as an evincer?

Peleg: (in Erawan) Not always. I was given enhancements.

Thane: Hey says they gave him Ribatol.

Dagan: Well damn, why can't you do that, too?

Thane: I don't think drugs are enough to produce results like that. Erawan
soldiers train for years at esteemed temples. The training I got is nothing in
comparison.

Peleg: (in Erawan) Thane, what day is it?

Thane: (in Erawan) It's Dormancy 4. Why? How long were you in that thing?

Peleg: (in Erawan) Since Wither 20.

Thane: (in Erawan) Over 70 days... Is that... normal?

Peleg: 

Sensory deprivation

<button class="collapsible">Event Horizon</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane, Dagan, and Peleg have taken cover behind a corner. Thane is peeking
around the corner. In an instant, Peleg screams and gunfire sounds behind
them.]

Thane: What...?

[Two Cheminan soldiers are standing opposite them with machine guns. Thane
looks back to see Peleg and Dagan collapsed on the floor and bleeding.]

Thane: Shit! Dagan!

Peleg: (in Erawan) Shoot them!

[Thane raises his gun and aims back toward the soldiers, only for them to have
vanished. He again turns back to his friends.]

Thane: How the fuck did this happen?

Dagan: Bastards came out of nowhere.

Thane: Did Peleg...? Oh no.

[Peleg lies unconscious in a pool of his own blood. Thane begins tearing off
some bandages for Dagan.]

Thane: I've got you. Hold on.

Dagan: Thane, you can't be serious. Look at me.

Thane: No! Fuck you, the reason I came here in the first place was so we could
all escape Chemina together. I'm not leaving you! I... I can't do this alone...

Dagan: You don't have a choice. I didn't ask for this to happen, but it did, so
suck it up and get out of here.

[Thane pushes up Dagan's shirt and examines the wounds.]

Thane: Just keep talking. I'm gonna get you out of here.

[Dagan's voice slowly becomes weaker and raspier.]

Dagan: Stop ignoring me! Thane, listen. The soldiers that shot me literally
appeared in front of my eyes. And they vanished just as fast. You need to figure
out what you're going to do if that happens again.

[Thane puts Dagan's arm over one of the wounds and presses, causing him to
wince]

Thane: Keep as much pressure here as you can. I'm going to dress the wound.

Dagan: Stop wasting time and get out of here.

[Thane finishes dressing Dagan's wounds, then looks at Peleg.]

Thane: We're getting out of here together. This is non-negotiable.

# Maybe make it clear Peleg's powers are causing problems before this scene

Thane: I wonder if Peleg had anything to do with it. Unintentionally, I mean.
When you're that powerful, there's sometimes a risk of... Dagan? Dagan, stay
with me! This can't be happening... I won't let you die! You can't die! Dagan!
Dagan! Fucking wake up!

# As Thane shakes Dagan, a voice speaks from behind a cell door.

Asra: Thane? Is that you?

Thane: What the...? Asra?

# Thane looks down at Dagan, then gets up and sprints toward the noise.

Thane: Asra!

Asra: Thane, what are you doing here?

Thane: I'll explain later. Hold on a second.

# Thane presses his hand against the door and closes his eyes. The door opens on
# its own.

Asra: Whoa. How did you do that?

Thane: Hold on. Dagan's hurt.

# Thane and Asra rush out to kneel beside Dagan.

Asra: He's fading, but there's still a pulse. What he needs to do is rest.

Thane: We can't stay here.

Asra: Yeah, I figured. We'll have to carry him.

# Thane turns to Asra, and the two embrace.

Thane: I was so scared. I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

Asra: Yeah, me too. I'm so glad you're here.

Thane: I'll never let you out of my sight again. I promise.

# Asra kisses Thane on the cheek before turning back to Dagan.

Asra: Let's get him up.

# Asra and Thane hoist Dagan to his feet. Dagan stirs slightly.

Dagan: Shit, I'm still alive?

Asra: Don't sound so disappointed. How are you feeling?

Dagan: Awful. I've felt worse, though.

Thane: Come on, we're not out of the woods yet.

[Multiple Vollmers are now roll through the prison. Erawans and Cheminans
exchange fire. The breach in the wall is heavily fortified with Cheminan
forces.]

Asra: You went through all this to find me? Thane, you're really stupid, you
know that?

Thane: You're welcome.

Dagan: If we flee on foot we're going to be shot dead.

Asra: I was thinking the same thing.

# Thane points to a horse-drawn war chariot beside a building. Its rider is
# slumped over and bloody; the horse is still but looks to be on the brink of
# panic.

Thane: We could steal that chariot.

Dagan: Not ideal, but it's something.

# Thane approaches the chariot. The horse whinnies and bucks.

Thane: Easy, now...

# Thane puts a hand on its flank and manages to calm it down, after which the
# three of them climb into the chariot. As they turn it around and stay behind
# cover, they notice the hole in the wall is now guarded by three Vollmers.

Asra: Well shit, how are we getting past that?

Thane: There are still flat bombs going off everywhere. That means Erawans are
still inside the complex. If they manage to fight their way out, we can try and
use them as human shields.

Dagan: Makes sense. We used the assault to get inside. We can use their retreat
to get out.

Thane: I'm readying some smoke grenades. Best not to take any chances.

# After some time, there's a gigantic explosion by the entrance. One of the
# tanks is flipped upside down. A wave of chariots rush toward the entrance,

[The trio run into a forest, and the horse slows its pace with the terrain.]

Asra: We can't keep going in this thing. There's barely room between the trees.

Dagan: There's no way the horse can support all three of us. We'll have to go on
foot.

# The trio gets out of the chariot and unties the horse.

Dagan: Are we where I think we are?

Thane: Erawa? Has to be. Can't you feel how warm it is?

Asra: Fuck. Never thought I'd end up here again.

# They emerge from the trees into the ruins of a small village.

Thane: I haven't been to Tripsi in almost five years... This place is in utter
ruin.

Soldier: (in Erawan) The enemy!

# Erawan soldiers begin launching projectiles at the trio.

Thane: (in Erawan) Leave us alone, damn it!

Soldier: (in Erawan) Die, Cheminan scum!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Stranger</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio is fleeing from an Erawan throwing flat bombs. The Erawan is shot
from behind, and a Cheminan soldier approaches. Thane raises his gun.]

Cheminan: Whoa, calm down! I'm on your side!

[Thane lowers his gun.]

Thane: ... Sorry.

Cheminan: You alright? You look like shit.

Thane: Yeah.

[The Cheminan offers a hand to Thane, but he refuses and stands on his own.]

Cheminan: Didn't think there were any of us left out here. I don't recognize you
from our unit. Who are you?

Thane: You don't know who I am?

Dagan: Did you have to ask?

Cheminan: Am I supposed to? I don't recall Somoza sending any celebrities on a
counterassault mission.

Thane: I'm not a celebrity, I... Call me Jin.

Flint: I'm Flint. So, how'd you end up out here alone?

Thane: I'm not alone.

Flint: You know what I mean. Where's the rest of your platoon?

Thane: It's a long story.

Flint: Can't have been too long. The Erawan assault just happened.

Thane: I don't want to talk about it.

Flint: Suit yourself. As for me, the enemy baited our Vollmer into a ditch. All
went downhill from there, no pun intended. We scattered and broke formation. Not
sure what happened to everyone else.

Thane: Anything can happen in a pinch. Two steps in the wrong direction could
put you miles away from the rest of your team.

Dagan: Sounds like all of us are lucky to be alive.

Flint: How about we go try and round up whoever's left?

Thane: I can't do that. There's something I need to handle on my own.

Flint: Are you nuts? You won't make it alone.

Thane: Please, back off.

[Beat]

Flint: Well, I suppose I can't force you.

Thane: I'm going to go now.

Flint: Alright. Be safe out there.

[The trio walks away.]

Thane: That guy gives me the fucking creeps.

Asra: We're really lucky he didn't know who we were.

Thane: Maybe he does. Keep an eye out in case he decides to follow us.

<div class="content">

[The trio make their way into an abandoned house.]

Dagan: You really think we'll find anything in here?

Thane: I doubt we'll find food, but at the very least it should make for decent
shelter. I don't have the energy to do anything else today.

[Thane enters the kitchen and sees fresh fruit in a bowl on the table.]

Asra: This stuff can't be more than a few days old.

Thane: Maybe we should-

Old Man: (in Erawan) Who are you!?

Thane: What-

Old Man: (in Erawan) Cheminan! Haven't you taken enough from us already?

Thane: (in Erawan) Wait! I'm not-

[The man grabs a knife from the counter, fashions it into a flatbomb, and throws
it.]

Old Man: (in Erawan) Die!

[Thane reflexively raises his hand and deflects the knife, which bounces back
toward the man.]

Thane: No!

Old Man: (in Erawan) How-

[Thane tackles Asra to the floor just as it explodes violently.]

Asra: What... just happened?

[The trio get back up. The old man is dead, a shard of metal embedded in his
forehead.]

Thane: He tried to kill us with a flat bomb... And I tried to delay the
explosion. I guess it worked.

Asra: You can do that?

Thane: I... I did it without thinking.

[As Dagan surveys the man's wounds, a teenage boy enters the kitchen from
another room.]

Boy: (in Erawan) Dad!

[The boy looks at Thane, then screams and starts attacking him with his fists.]

Boy: (in Erawan) Killer! Why won't you people just leave us alone!?

[Thane tries to push the boy away. The boy persists, and Thane fires warning
shots from his gun, causing the boy to fall silent, then flee the house.]

Dagan: Fuck.

[Thane sits down on the floor, leaning on the wall, and breaks down crying.]

Thane: I can't take this anymore! Why did any of this have to happen? None of
this would have happened if we'd just gone somewhere else!

Asra: You need to keep moving. Come on.

[Thane leans over the man.]

Thane: I'm so sorry. You never asked for this. I didn't mean to...

<button class="collapsible">Family Ties</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio enter another old house, Thane holding a flashlight.]

Dagan: I don't like this.

Thane: Neither do I, but we don't have a choice. We need a place to spend the
night.

[As they make their way through a hall, a door opens and a woman steps out.]

Thane: (in Erawan) Get away from me!

Woman: (in Erawan) What...?

Thane: (in Erawan) I said get the fuck away from me!

Woman: (in Erawan) Do you need help? You look terrible.

[Thane pauses before answering. He sounds less panicked, but still tense.]

Thane: (in Erawan) We were just looking for a place to sleep. I didn't realize
someone was living here. Please just let us leave.

Woman: (in Erawan) You can stay here. You'll be safe for the night.

Thane: (in Erawan) ... What?

Woman: (in Erawan) That's what you need, isn't it?

Thane: (in Erawan) Yes, but-

Oda: (in Erawan) Then make yourself at home. There's too few of us left here in
this town for us not to take care of each other.

Thane: (in Erawan) But... we're Cheminan.

Oda: (in Erawan) Doesn't make much difference to me. If you wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead already, right? I'm Oda, by the way. Oda Stutz. And you are?

[Thane takes several deep breaths and tries to calm himself.]

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm Thane Belikoff.

Asra: Asra Sacco. It's a pleasure to meet you.

Dagan: I'm Dagan Belikoff.

Oda: (in Erawan) Belikoff? I don't suppose you know a man named Saito by any
chance?

Thane: (in Erawan) What...? That's my father!

Oda: (in Erawan) I see. Then you are Phaedra's son?

Thane: (in Erawan) Who... are you?

Oda: (in Erawan) Phaedra is my little sister. How is she doing?

Dagan: I heard her say Phaedra. Who is this woman?

Thane: She's... your sister-in-law. (in Erawan) My mother was... taken away. I
haven't seen her since I was little.

Oda: (in Erawan) I should have expected as much. When your mother defected to
Chemina, I was imprisoned as punishment, as was the rest of the family. I was
afraid to contact her after that.

Thane: (in Erawan) How did you end up in Tripsi? I thought my mother was from
Merad.

Oda: (in Erawan) The locals of Merad were not kind to me when I was released.
I had nothing, so this was where I ended up. The rest the family was... less
fortunate.

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm so sorry.

Oda: (in Erawan) I suppose I should ask what you're doing here in Erawa.

Thane: (in Erawan) We were trying to escape to Debony but we got a bit
sidetracked. It's a long story.

Oda: (in Erawan) I guess The grass is always greener on the other side, isn't
it? Phaedra running to Chemina, and now you trying to escape, too.

Thane: (in Erawan) A lot changed since Somoza won the war. At least, that's what
my dad told me. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

Oda: (in Erawan) I would love to, Thane. Trust me, I would. But there's no
country in Kabel that wants to take in an Erawan refugee. Besides, it looks like
you've had quite the adventure. I doubt I'm in good enough health for that sort
of thing.

Dagan: She's got a point. Even I'm going to have a hard time convincing the
Debonese government to let me stay, seeing as I'm not an engineer. I might have
to be a confectioner.

Thane: ...

Oda: (in Erawan) Go get some rest. I can tell you need it.

<button class="collapsible">Reminiscing About Vanna</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio settle down in a small room, Thane and Asra on a bed. Dagan sleeps in
an armchair.]

Asra: I've been thinking... about killing.

Thane: Yeah?

Asra: Ever since you killed Vanna... I don't know, the weight of what that
actually means is more clear now. It doesn't feel good anymore. And I think
that's a good thing.

Thane: I guess I forgot how close you were with her.

[Beat]

Asra: Vanna used to have a little sister. She died before I was born, but Vanna
told me about her once. Seraphim. She was a gentle soul. A medic, just like me.
When the Civil War broke out, she treated people on both sides, even though
Vanna begged her to stay home instead. One day Somoza's men gunned down the
medical tent and that was that. Sometimes it felt like Vanna wanted me to
replace Seraphim. Like if I could be tougher than she was, Vanna would feel
better about not doing more for her sister.

Thane: Doesn't sound like there was anything she could have done. You can't tell
other people what to do.

Asra: I think she knew that. But she still felt guilty anyway, even though she
acted tough.

Thane: Dagan's the same way. He and Mom were really close. Like, looking back as
an adult I'm pretty sure they had a thing. When she was taken away, something
about him changed. He was always kind of strict, but there were several years
after Mom left when I was actually afraid of him. I guess losing someone you
love can do that to you.

Asra: But Dagan still wanted to stay neutral?

Thane: (Sigh) Mom... wanted to be turned in. You remember Dagan talking about
how they killed kids just because their parents were dissidents? Well, Mom said
that was the only way to prove I was being "raised right."

[Beat]

Thane: Everyone's made sacrifices for me, and it's just like... why? So I can
get my head blown off trying to jump the border?

Oda: (in Erawan) Where are you headed?

Thane: (in Erawan) Back toward the border. I'm trying to get to Rega.

Oda: (in Erawan) You should try and avoid any Erawans you come across. Phaedra
was always very open to new people - I think that's why she fell in love with
your father - but most people, especially in Tripsi, are much more small-minded.

Thane (in Erawan): Yeah, we ran into... Actually, it's not important. I'll be
careful. Thank you so much for everything.

Oda (in Erawan): No, thank you. It's good to know I have a nephew, and that he's
alive and well, even if my sister wasn't so lucky. Be safe, Thane.

Dagan: How do you plan on making it across the border? Security in Rega is
already high, but after the attack on Nenegi there's no way we'll make it
across.

Thane: We're all Cheminan, aren't we? We can just say we were taken prisoner and
escaped.

Dagan: So what happens after that? Cheminan or not, we're dead as soon as they
identify us.

Thane: I doubt they're looking for us in Rega. It should be easy enough to lie.
Or we could just bribe them.

Dagan: That's not going to work.

Thane: Actually... I just had an idea.

# Thane pulls a locket from his pack and opens it. One half contains a photo of
# Saito. The other is a mirror.

Asra: What are you doing?

Thane: You know those illusions where you stare at something for ten seconds and
the image gets burned into your eyes?

Asra: Yeah, I think it's called iconic memory? Wait, you said illusion. Does
that mean you can use evincing to disguise yourself?

Thane: Only one way to find out.

# Thane stares at the photo of Saito, then into the mirror. After a few tries,
# he takes on Saito's appearance.

Thane: Hopefully this lasts long enough for us to cross the border. But what
about you two?

Asra: Wait, I know!

# Asra digs around in her pack and pulls out two photographs taken from fallen
# soldiers. Thane takes them.

Asra: Guess it wasn't such a bad idea to hold onto these, huh?

Thane: Alright, stand still.

# Thane repeats the process with both Asra and Dagan.

Dagan: Did it work?

Thane: Yes, but try not to look at each other. Your expectations might undo the
change.

Dagan: Won't we change back when border security looks at us?

Thane: They don't know what you're supposed to look like, so their expectations
aren't going to do anything.

# The trio finally approach the checkpoint and are greeted by border security.

Guard: You look like shit. Where are you coming from?

Thane: There was a prison break in Merad. We barely escaped with our lives.

# The guard looks at Thane suspiciously.

Guard: And you were the only one that made it out?

Thane: Just us, yeah.

Guard: "Us?"

Thane: Yeah.

Guard: Name and identification?

Thane: My name is Jin Knox. Our IDs were confiscated when we were captured.

Guard: No one crosses without identification.

Thane: Alright then. How about this?

Asra: Shit... That could have been us.

Thane: Yeah. I really can't believe how lucky we've been this whole time.

Dagan: I have to agree. The odds have been against us from the start, and
they've only gotten worse.

Asra: I'm just throwing this out there, but if we'd really been lucky, I
wouldn't have been captured in the first place.

Thane: Well if you want to take that angle... If we'd been lucky, Dagan wouldn't
have had to kill the officers that tried to drag me away.

# The trio pass a man, who approaches Thane.

Man: Excuse me, do you have a moment?

Dagan: As a matter of fact, we do not.

Siegfried: My name is Siegfried. I am here on behalf of a group of people like
yourselves - young men and women committed to change.

Thane: I'm not interested.

Siegfried: Really? I think you're just the type-

Thane: Not interested. Fuck off.

Siegfried: I know who you are, Belikoff.

Thane: What do you want?

Siegfried: Calm down. If I had any intention of turning you in, do you really
think I would be confronting you like this? I know you are armed and dangerous,
yet still I approach you alone and unarmed. Do I look like I want a fight?

Dagan: Why are you looking for us here? Why are you looking for us at all?

Siegfried: We have ears in many places.

Siegfried: You must understand why the assassins of Farid Somoza would draw my
interest, especially given that you were able to destroy the airship deployed
immediately after. Moreover...

Siegfried: The ability to defeat and commandeer a Vollmer on foot is not likely
to escape our interest. I decided to track you down because we need people like
you on our side.

Thane: Everything we did was out of self-preservation and opportunism. Stop
trying to recruit us into your little group. We're not interested. Get out of my
face.

Siegfried: You're in Rega because you're planning to stow away on a cargo ship,
yes?

Thane: ...

Siegfried: The port is closed until tomorrow. You and I both know this. I can
offer you shelter for the night. All I ask in return is that you listen to what
I have to say.

Asra: Why should we trust you?

Siegfried: That again? I already told you, I wouldn't approach you like this if
I were after your bounties. Besides, the police are after me, too.

Thane: ...

Siegfried: Not in the mood to talk? That's fine. I'm going back to our base. If
you're interested, follow.

Dagan: Got any better ideas?

Thane: Unfortunately, no.

# The trio follow Siegfried into the ruins of the Rega massacre.

Thane: All this destruction...

Asra: Mom... Dad...

Siegfried: You're Asra, yes? I was not aware you had family here. I'm sorry for
your loss. Are you from Rega?

Asra: Nenegi, actually. My parents worked here.

Siegfried: I see.

Thane: Why wouldn't they just build a memorial over the ruins? This is...

Dagan: Depressing? I imagine that's on purpose. These shelled buildings serve to
remind people of the constant threat. It keeps people afraid.

# Siegfried leads the group past a locked grated door and into the sewer system.
# Thane turns on his flashlight and looks around.

Dagan: Your organization is stationed here?

Siegfried: Yes. You are surprised?

Thane: Why a sewer?

Siegfried: The sewers allow us access to much of the city while keeping us out
of sight. And since we're under the ruins, we can escape to street level without
being immediately surrounded.

# The group is led to a small room with a bare mattress.

Siegfried: I'm afraid this is all we have. It's not much, but it's safe and dry.

Thane: Thank you.

Siegfried: It's late, and I have some business to attend to. I've done my half
of the deal. We can discuss the other half tomorrow.

has been a train wreck.

Asra: Thane, I know it's kind of early to talk about this but...

Thane: Yes?

Asra: When we escape, would you want things to be... more serious?

Thane: You mean marriage?

Asra: Yeah. I don't want to rush you if you aren't ready yet.

Thane: No, I'm ready. If we make it to Debony, I think... I think it would make
sense.

Asra: If that isn't motivation, I don't know what is.

# Siegfried approaches the group.

Siegfried: Sleep well?

Thane: Well enough. 

Siegfried: As I said earlier, I would have you listen to my offer. A small price
to pay for shelter, I think.

Asra: Are you a terrorist organization?

Siegfried: That's a rather blunt question. But an important one, I suppose. To
the Somoza regime, perhaps. We aim to disrupt. But more important is the vision
all of us share for a better Chemina.

Dagan: Which is?

Siegfried: We are sick of this pointless war. We are sick of Somoza's draconic
labor camps, kin punishment, public execution, and constant surveillance. We aim
to overthrow the regime and give the country back to its people.

Dagan: You guys must have a death wish.

Siegfried: Perhaps. But I would rather die fighting for myself and my loved ones
than for a dictator forcing me to kill innocent people.

Asra: I understand why you're doing this. I felt the same way for a long time.
But I've started to imagine how easy it would be to just run away instead. What
use are vengeance or freedom if you're not around to enjoy them?

Thane: I'm surprised. I mean, you really wanted me to kill Somoza.

Asra: To be honest, I'm surprised too. For a while I kept having this back and
forth... I wanted to see the big picture, but the more I fought, the more it was
turning me into someone else.

Thane: I think I understand.

Asra: It was also easy to tell myself that nothing was certain, like escape was
a far away pipe dream. But we're so close now, and I can't throw that away.

Siegfried: Have the two of you made the same decision as well?

Dagan: My priority was always to leave the country as soon as possible. That
hasn't changed.

Thane: Likewise.

Siegfried: I will ask one last time. This is a chance to be part of something
larger than yourselves, to fight back when before you could only run and hide.
You've been fighting for yourselves. This is a chance to fight for others. That
holds no appeal to you?

Asra: My neighbor ratted me out to claim a bounty on my head. If it weren't for
Thane I'd have been executed. Your idealism is charming, but I'd rather protect
people I know I can trust. And starting a revolution isn't my idea of protecting
anyone.

Thane: Same goes for me. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I have too
much to live for to gamble it away like this. So if you don't mind, the three of 
us will be on our way now.

Siegfried: Most unfortunate. I hoped it would not come to this, but you leave me
no other choice. This is my final offer. You join us, or we turn you in.

# Siegfried draws a pistol.

Asra: Is this some kind of bad joke? The police are hunting you, too.

Siegfried: Not all of us.

Dagan: And you think we won't expose your little operation if you do?

Siegfried: Why do you think we're not letting you leave? There was always a risk
you'd be captured and expose us under torture. If you really won't join us,
we'll have to turn in your bodies.

Thane: You're making a big mistake.

Siegfried: No, you are. I'm offering the choice between fighting an abusive
dictatorship and forcing your hand against men and women that only want the same
thing you do. It is not too late to reconsider your options.

Dagan: You're not as charming as you think you are. But if I'm not in a position
to refuse, I won't try. State your conditions.

Siegfried: I knew you would come to your senses. Come with me. I'd like you to
meet some of our friends.

Siegfried: I'd like for them to accompany you and Ondine to the Rega Coal Plant.

Ondine: On their first day here? You can't be serious. We don't even know who
these people are! Something this important-

Siegfried: Something this important needs all hands on deck. We're short on
manpower and these three will make a critical difference.

Ondine: And you're sure we can trust them?

Siegfried: You're better off with them than without them, if that's your
concern. I trust you and Kilan can hold your own if something goes wrong.

Kilan: I can take care of myself.

Thane: Mind telling us what this is all about?

Ondine: We're blowing up a coal plant.

Thane: Wait, what? Five people for a whole power plant? Are you insane!?

Siegfried: Contain yourself. Somoza always stages attacks on Cheminan soil
before drafting more soldiers. That means he's drawing resources away from
everything else, including domestic security. Five people should be sufficient.

Dagan: Hold on. What do you mean, "stages attacks?"

Siegfried: The assault on Nenegi Corrections Facility, of course. You don't
actually think Erawa was behind that, do you?

Thane: The attackers were Erawan. We were there. We saw them.

Siegfried: Erawan mercenaries. On Somoza's payroll, of course. Certainly not
conventional military.

Thane: Hold on-

Asra: You make it sound like Somoza's done this before. Did he have anything to
do with the Rega Massacre?

Siegfried: Ah... I'd forgotten how your parents died. Yes, that was Somoza's
work as well.

Asra: ...

Ondine: If you're serious about sending them, we'd better give them a briefing.

Kilan: I can help with that. So did Siegfried tell you these sewers run under
the whole city?

Thane: Yeah, he said something like that.

Kilan: Okay, good. That's our main method of getting around without being seen.

Asra: We need to find a cargo ship without tropical barnacles on it. Those are
the ones going to Debony.

Thane: Got it. Let's take a look around.

Dagan: This probably doesn't need to be said, but I'm going to remind you two
anyway. We really can't afford to be recognized here. There's no room for error
if we're seen. These ports shut down at the first sign of conflict, and if that
happens we're shit out of luck.

Thane: I'll be careful, but to be honest I'm not too concerned about being
hunted down at this point. The government is probably more focused on the attack
on Nenegi. I'm sure a lot of their manpower has been redirected to the border.

Asra: If they're still cleaning up the mess the Erawans made, they might not
even know I've escaped yet.

Thane: They almost certainly don't know all three of us are still travelling
together. So if they're looking at all, it's probably for a group of two.

Asra: Still, Dagan's right. We do need to be extra careful if we're going to
make it onto one of these ships.

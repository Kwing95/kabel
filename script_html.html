<button class="collapsible">Arc Notes</button>
<div class="content">

Spend Rega chapter delving into Asra's character arc. Have her overcome her fear
of becoming addicted to killing (in other words, 'fake' development.)

Have Asra sleep with an officer to bribe them. This hammers home her character
being uncompromising in doing whatever it takes to survive; she has more 'fight'
left in her than the disillusioned Thane or Diego.

Give Diego a personal connection with one of the towns earlier on to give him
some time for his charater to be developed. Perhaps one of the areas was central
in the Cheminan Civil War, and Diego spent a lot of time here as a journalist.

## CHAPTER 1: MERAD ##
######################

<button class="collapsible">Panoramic</button>
<div class="content">
# An urban city street fades into view. Civilians scatter as a formation
# of troops march forward.

Twenty years ago, the country of Chemina erupted in civil war. Farid Somoza and
his militia emerged victorious and claimed the nation as their own.

# The screen fades to a timelapse of a skyline, with smoke stacks and
# street lights appearing one at a time.

Somoza saw promise in coal and electrical power, creating an economic powerhouse
from the emerging industries.

Soon after, a campaign was launched to occupy the neighboring territory of Erawa
and use its mystic properties as an energy source.

# Evincers are shown driving back Cheminan soldiers with projectile attacks

The Erawan government considered this exploitation impious, expunging the
occupation and thrusting the two nations into protracted conflict.

Bane: Saito, move!!

Saito: Ugh...

# Saito gets up into a crouching position. Bane provides cover fire as Saito
# runs to join him behind the house.

Saito: We're getting hammered out here.

Bane: That's what happens when you take the fight to their doorstep.

# An earth-shaking blast knocks them both to the ground.

Bane: Those things travel so damned far...

Saito: You mean the flat bombs?

Bane: The what?

Saito: Flat bombs. You take an object, compress it to a fraction of its original
size, then throw it. When it's out of sight, it expands so violently that it
causes an explosion.

Bane: Where did you learn that?

Saito: My late wife was an Erawan refugee.

Bane: ...

Saito: Save it for later. We've got company.

Thane: "I regret to inform you that Saito Belikoff was reported killed in action
while deployed in Merad, Erawa. I hope you can find solace in the knowledge of
his heroic service to the state. I extend my deepest sympathy to you."

Asra: ...

Thane: Think it's true?

Asra: That he died on the battlefield? Maybe. Could've been blown up. Could've
been put down. Both happen pretty often.

Diego: It's time to leave. There's nothing left for us here.

Thane: Now?

Asra: There isn't much for us to wait around for, is there? I'm sure I'll be
deployed soon.

Thane: That is true. Somoza keeps people on active duty so their families can't
escape without leaving them behind.

Diego: Get the books from the cellar. I don't want them laying around after we
leave.

Asra: How can your uncle care so little about his own brother?

Thane: Diego's lost a lot of family. He doesn't have the energy to grieve
anymore. But you shouldn't take that to mean that he doesn't care.

Asra: And what about you?

Thane: I'm sure he cares about how I'm feeling. He just doesn't know how to show
it.

Asra: No, I mean how are you feeling?

Thane: Er, sad? In shock? I don't know. I think I need some time to process
everything that's going through my head right now. What are you thinking?

Asra: Is it bad if I say I'm really ready to leave this place?

Thane: No. You're in the military reserve. I'm sure you're thinking how easily
that letter could have been about you instead.

Asra: Actually... I was thinking about how both of our parents are gone now. I
just want to go somewhere else and not think about all of this anymore. But I
feel like that's mentally pushing your dad under the rug.

Thane: I can't expect you to feel the same way about my dad as I do. You barely
knew him. Besides, Diego seems pretty ready to leave, too.

Asra: Heh... Can't believe we finally agree on something.

we get raided.

Thane: I was actually going to ask if you were okay with traveling with Asra. I
know you two don't get along.

Diego: Asra's the only one with connections that could get us out of here. Plus
she knows you're half Erawan. If we left her here she'd be taken into custody and there's no telling what she'd say.

Thane: Five.

Asra: That's pretty young to be lecturing your kid about politics.

Thane: He said all the children's books were "nationalistic garbage" so he read
these to me instead. Even though he had to paraphrase most of it. Kind of weird
to think he's not here to protect the book from me this time.

Asra: You shouldn't think of it that way.

Thane: Why not?

Asra: Those books made you who you are. They've served their purpose. We're only
burning them now because we're making room for a new life - one where we can be
safe from Somoza and this stupid war. If Saito could see you now he'd be proud.

Thane: How can you say that? You never even knew him.

Asra: Okay. What would he really think of you?

<button class="collapsible">Erawa At a Glance</button>
<div class="content">

Paranormal phenomena were first observed in Erawa in the sixth century, though
their nature has been closely guarded by the Erawan Empire. Indeed, nearly half
a millennia passed before Zeke Salow observed that the magnitude and frequency

of these events correlated with their proximity to the center of the peninsula.

Legends of Erawan magicians known as evincers had existed for centuries, but it
wasn't until Salow interviewed defected practitioners that he theorized the
center of Erawa contained what he called a 'subjective fracture in objective

reality,' which enabled the temporary suspension of physical law. Evincers
trained to exploit the Fracture, primarily manipulating the natural tundra into
a tropical rainforest suitable for agriculture and resource production, as well

as a source of military power during the period of Cheminan colonization.

Erawa's geography is also a topic of debate. According to mythology, its
distinct shape is a result of ancient evincers causing the land to physically
expand outward from the Fracture itself, resulting in a perfectly round

landmass. However, skeptics argue that such profound influence over the terrain
so far from the center is virtually impossible.
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Beyond Reality: What the Fracture Means for Modern Society</button>
<div class="content">

The exact nature of the Fracture is unknown - reality becomes increasingly
unstable as one approaches it. Within a forty-mile radius, objects from an
observer's imagination begin to materialize, and objects not being actively

observed may dematerialize. Beyond a thirty mile radius, unconscious eye
movements cause earthquakes, and measurement tools begin to malfunction.
Experienced evincers are able to dampen these effects, but there are no

confirmed records of the center having been reached.

Because of this, Erawa is divided into five territories shaped like concentric
rings around the center. The ectosphere houses civilians, whose prowess in
evincing is typically modest. The endosphere is home to the aristocracy, who

wield significantly more paranormal power. Beyond this layer is the introsphere,
which requires specific training and discipline to enter safely. As a result,
only devoted evincers and shaman are able to live here. The metasphere lies

beyond this, and while the effects of the Fracture are too potent for this area
to be permanently inhabitable, it is often a staple of an evincer's spiritual
journey. The cryptosphere is the innermost layer, and is the event horizon for

all human activity. Those that cross this boundary are never seen again.

The nature of the center is a topic of fierce debate. Zeke Salow denied that the
itself could have any concrete shape, insisting that complete subversion of
objective reality contradicted the idea of a physical form. He went on to

postulate that a point of purely subjective reality might 'explain the spark of
consciousness that transformed blood-bots into what we call life.'
	
</div>

<button class="collapsible">A Brief History of Cheminan-Erawan Relations
</button>
<div class="content">

Due to the Erawan Empire's reliance on a natural landmark which proved
ineffective outside of the local territory, the state adopted isolationist
policies, much to the detriment of foreign relations. Erawan-Cheminan diplomacy

only soured in the wake of the Cheminan's industrialization, during which
engineers proposed using the Fracture to construct a perpetual energy machine.
This sparked outrage among Erawan activists who considered technological

exploitation of the Fracture heresy, escalating political tensions to an
all-out war.

Although Chemina has no shortage of trade partners following their emergence as
an economic superpower, the possibility of military intervention by a foreign
body is slim. Developed countries have expressed concerns over Chemina's

political instability and the risk of its supreme leader Farid Somoza using the
Fracture to wage a world war, were it ever secured. Consequently, the two
nations have been locked in a stalemate.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Colonialization in Lamenir</button>
<div class="content">

Lamenir has a unique ecological history; it is the only landmass with no natural
hunters. As all of its native meat-eaters have instead adapted to living as
scavengers, aggressive behavior is not observed within its wildlife or people.

It is the lack of aggression in the Lamenir people for which its subjugation is
often attributed. Indeed, it took less than a century for 10% of its total
population to be enslaved by Debonese colonists.

In recent years, mining of raw materials in Lamenir has become a staple in the
global economy, supplying Chemina with coal and iron which are refined into
consumer goods and shipped around the globe.

Thane: My mom taught me a little bit growing up, but only spoken. I don't know
how to read at all.

Asra: So why did you keep the scriptures after Phaedra was taken?

Thane: I'm not sure. All of these are banned, but Erawan literature is by far
the biggest liability.

Asra: What about A Brief History? Doesn't it have a lot of contemporary history?

Thane: A Brief History was published in the United Territories. I'm really not
sure how my dad got a hold of it. I'm sure we'll be able to get another copy if
we make it out of here.

Asra: That thing looks ancient.

Thane: It's not that much older than we are. Probably just looks like it
because we never see them anymore.

Asra: I can't believe your dad fought Somoza's troops back before he rose to
power. Your family's so much more interesting than mine.

# Thane looks down.

Thane: Didn't do them much good, did it? Mom died in the internment camps, and
now Dad's... I'm sorry. It's not like you haven't lost family yourself.

Asra: I'm still grateful, you know. After the Rega Massacre you were all I had
left. There were a lot of people that had nowhere to go. Thanks for taking me
in.

Thane: Asra, I love you. You know I love you. Did you really think I wouldn't
open my doors for you?

Asra: I'm still thankful.

# Thane holds the books and flag in a fireplace shovel.

Thane: Does anyone want to look at these one last time?

Diego: ...

# Thane thrusts the books into the fire. Diego leaves the room. After a moment
# of silence, he walks over to Asra.

Asra: Guess the censors won.

Thane: Weren't you just saying we had to get rid of these?

Asra: Yeah. I can only imagine what Diego's thinking, though. Wasn't he a war
correspondent during the Civil War?

Thane: Kind of. Things got... weird.

Asra: You mean when he had to pledge his loyalty to Somoza?

Thane: According to my dad, it was actually earlier than that. Even before
Somoza won, Diego wanted to stay neutral. He reported numbers and took photos.

Asra: What about when Phaedra was taken away?

# Thane pauses and looks around.

Thane: By the time Mom was captured, it was clear Somoza was going to win. I
guess Diego wanted to be on the winning side. Even Dad did, although he said it
was only to keep me safe.

Asra: He lost his wife, pledged his loyalty to the man that had her killed, and
after all that Somoza forced him back onto the battlefield. That's so fucked up.

Thane: Asra, I really don't want to think about that right now...

Asra: And now all Diego does is write pro-Somoza propaganda.

Thane: I don't know what to tell you. He's a good writer and it pays the bills.
Neither of us would be here if it weren't for him. That said, a lot of those
books were his. You'd think he'd at least care a little about burning them.

Asra: You said it yourself, didn't you? He did what he had to in order to get
by. We all have feelings but we can't let them get in the way of pragmatism.

kind of modern convenience anywhere else in the world.

Thane: That's funny coming from you. Aren't you always talking about how great
the United Territories is?

Diego: Politically, sure. But we've still got a lock on technology. You have to
be pretty rich just to get a refrigerator if you live overseas.

Asra: Don't they live like savages?

Diego: Of course not! They've got all your basic necessities - horse and buggy,
ice boxes, that kind of stuff. Just like when you were a baby.

Diego: Quit standing around. We have to move! Take these.

# Diego hands Thane a rifle and Asra a revolver.

Asra: Diego, you know I'm a medic, right?

Diego: Doesn't matter. We're not trying to rack up a body count here, but having
some suppressive fire could be a good idea.

Thane: Where did you even get these?

Diego: My brother was a bit of a kleptomaniac. When it was clear Somoza was
winning the war, he started collecting weapons from fallen enemies. Once the war
was over his service weapon was taken but he was able to hide these.

Thane: I had no idea. Wait, why weren't they in the book cellar?

Diego: Hell if I know. Saito hid them in the bedroom. Pretty reckless
considering what would have happened if we'd ever been raided, but I guess
keeping them handy finally paid off.

Asra: Looks like we're leaving earlier than expected. Good thing we're already
packed.

Thane: What the hell did they want from me?

Diego: Who knows? My guess is some double-checked Saito's family records when he
died and realized you were half Erawan. No use worrying about it now.

Thane: Just to be clear, we're headed for Nenegi, right?

Asra: Yeah. That's where Vanna is. She'll help us escape.

# Asra opens the door.

Asra: We really need to go.

Diego: Shit. It's after curfew. Look, in case things go to shit-

Asra: They already have.

Diego: Brilliant observation. Anyway, don't let anyone shoot at you. Kill them
before they even know you're there. If they start shooting back, you've already
lost.

Thane: Were people this underhanded during the Civil War?

Diego: "Underhanded" is a pejorative used to make people follow the rules of
some arbitrary leader. Fighting honorably is the same as surrendering to the
side with the most guns.

Asra: I thought we weren't trying to kill anyone.

Diego: We're not. This isn't like what you're used to in Erawa. We should be
running and hiding when we can. But if that fails, don't take chances. Don't
gamble with your life. Now let's go.

All three are considered to be armed and dangerous."

Asra: Why didn't they mention that you were resisting arrest in the first place?
Wouldn't they want to make you look like the bad guy?

better to make it look like a random act of violence.

Asra: I'm a murderer now. And the... thing is... fuck.

Thane: Hey, calm down. Trust me, I know. It's hard when-

Asra: It's not hard! That's why I'm so fucking scared!

Thane: ...

Asra: I never wanted to be drafted into the service. I never wanted to be a
medic, either. But I was able to accept it because I could tell myself at least
I was helping people. But something about killing just felt... exciting.

Thane: Everyone has their own way of handling extreme situations.

Asra: It's not even about that. It's that I liked it! What does that say about
who I am? What if I just get worse and I lose control? This isn't who I want to
be.

Thane: It's going to be alright. We're not soldiers and we're not here to fight.
Once we're in Debony you won't have to think about any of this anymore.

Asra: Even if we make it... I'm scared of myself, Thane.

Diego: Hey-

Malik: Whatever. Not my business. Give me a second.

# Malik closes the door.

Thane: Do you always struggle to find clothes that fit?

Diego: Not always, but it's pretty common. Really asinine how poorly stocked
most places are.

Asra: Give them a break. You are a pretty big guy.

Diego: No I'm not. It's that the rest of you are all so damned small. Your whole

Asra: But that's the thing. It's like you can keep going and you still hate
doing it. I don't know why I'm growing to enjoy it so quickly. I feel like I'm

shoot anyway.

Diego: I know I'm not a part of this conversation, but that's sick.

Thane: Shut up. Please just shut up.

Asra: ...

Thane: I know you don't want to keep fighting, but you shouldn't do this to

Thane: Asra, don't-

Diego: It's not about what I've invented, or what anyone's invented for that

own history, and then you think engineering is the only thing worth knowing.

Asra: Not everyone has to be like you, Diego! Different people-

Diego: Everyone needs to know why things are the way they are right now! You
can't raise a whole generation of engineers to be subservient workers that shirk

Asra: My parents died that day! If anyone has a right to be upset over what
happened, I do!

Diego: That's exactly my point. Kowalski isn't from Rega; he's from Chalt. He
doesn't give a shit about your parents, he's just trying to make people angry so
they'll keep fighting in the war.

Asra: Are you saying we should just forget about everyone that died!?

Diego: No. I'm saying that we shouldn't be standing on dead bodies like a podium

Diego: I think change is coming. But I also think Somoza's biting off more than
he can chew. If he keeps trying to trade technology like gold and spices it's
going to blow up in his face.

Thane: Why? He's been leader my whole life and I've never seen something so much
as threaten his rule.

Diego: It's not about politics, it's about the technology itself. It's taken all
of 40 years to go from steam engines to biplanes. It's great for him in the
short-term, but eventually the market is going to grow until it overtakes him.

Asra: Yeah, except Somoza controls the market, too.

Diego: His official position is supreme leader. Dictator or not, the title
weighs him down. He's not in a position to cope with the changes technology is
bringing.

Asra: You said yourself Chemina has a lock on technology. If Somoza won't be in
control of the economy, who will be?

Diego: Countries are already starting to reverse engineer our things. It's only
a matter of time before Chemina has competitors, and when that happens, Somoza
will start losing his footing.

Thane: So anyone that wants to rule Kabel will have to do it through the
economy. But what's to say Somoza still won't be that person?

Diego: Have you heard him talk? Somoza's too stubborn to survive the changes
he's causing. If you look at how rapidly technology spreads, it makes sense. I'm
not sure any government can handle those kinds of changes.

Asra: That makes even less sense. You still haven't said who's going to pick up
the slack and benefit the most from all this.

Diego: If I had to guess, I'd say pirates. Governments are anchored to their
land, but technology can go anywhere its blueprints can. Anyone that takes that
information from place to place is going to have a lot of power.

Asra: This is going to sound impulsive, but I don't care. We're just three
people, Thane. What are our lives worth compared to the millions suffering
because of him?

Thane: Now you're starting to sound like the revolutionary. I didn't think you
would be so eager to do this.

Asra: My family might have been misinformed but we weren't naive. I was taught
in school to love Somoza, but we were also afraid. There's only so much you can
fear someone before you start to resent them. I want him dead.

Thane: So do I, but I also want to make it out of this country alive. I want to
have a future with you.

Asra: What if someone else had the same chance to kill him, but didn't? What if
they said the same thing you did? We can't let this slip through our fingers.

Thane: Weren't you just saying you were afraid of how bloodthirsty you were
becoming? Are you sure this is what you want?

Asra: This is different. I'm not the one holding the gun. And I've wanted Somoza
dead long before we decided we wanted to go to Debony. Believe it or not, I'm
actually quite calm right now.

border? Aren't you more important than that? Aren't I?

Asra: I don't want to bully you into getting yourself killed based on my whim.
If I were a good enough shot I'd shoot him myself and take full responsibility,
but I'm not. I don't think it's right for me to make the decision for us all.

Thane: You didn't answer my question. Does killing him mean that much to you?

Asra: I... don't know. I do love you. But what if we don't shoot him and we
still get caught trying to flee? What if we pass up this chance and it's all for
nothing?

Thane: What if I shoot and miss? There's always a chance something could go
wrong.

Asra: We have a really good position. I don't think you'll miss. You could shoot
his balls off if you wanted to.

Thane: Actually... that's not a bad idea.

Asra: What?

Thane: Think about it. If I killed him, his son would succeed him and everyone
would scared of him instead. I castrated him, he'd still be supreme leader, but
it would seriously hurt his image.

Asra: It might just look like a failed assassination attempt.

Thane: That's true. Except there are thousands of witnesses out there.

Asra: So you're going to shoot him?

Thane: I... don't know.

Diego: I'd think twice before pulling that trigger. You know his son is just
going to take over, right? Besides, his regime is doomed to fall even without
our help.

Thane: Yeah, but-

Diego: But what? What's done is done. You can't bring back the people that are
already dead, and killing Somoza now isn't going to help anyone either. Changing
the world is more complicated than shooting bad guys.

Thane: He still deserves to die.

Diego: Sure he does. But are you going to throw all of our lives away based on
who deserves what?

Thane: Are you telling me not to shoot him?

Diego: ... No. I don't ever want to tell someone the story about how my nephew
almost killed Farid Somoza until I talked him out of it. I could never live with
myself.

Thane: What do you want, then?

Diego: I'm staying neutral.

Thane: You haven't changed at all since the Civil War, have you? Is this the
tail end of your journalistic objectivity?

Diego: Thane, my integrity went out the window after your mom was taken away. I
don't believe in that kind of stuff anymore.

Thane: ...

Diego: My actions at that time were rooted in self-preservation. This is
different. I'm letting you make this choice yourself, even if it kills me.

Thane: You're just putting your life in my hands that easily? Does this mean
anything to you?

Diego: Of course. This is extremely important to me, but both choices have
merit. That's why I'm fine with whatever you choose to do. Just make sure
whatever you do, it's for a good reason.

<button class="collapsible">Waylaid</button>
<div class="content">

# Diego, Asra, and Thane ride past trees and smokestacks in the Vollmer Armored
# Car.

Thane: I always wanted to see your hometown, but I never imagined it like this.

Asra: Really? Ever since the day I met you I dreamed of running away with you,
only to come back home in a three-ton Vollmer.

Thane: Alright, point taken. Still, I wish I'd gotten to know your parents.

# Asra smiles weakly.

Asra: Stop romanticizing it like that, Thane. I already told you they were
ignorant. If they'd known I was seeing some half-Erawan guy...

Thane: What if they didn't know? Do you think we would have gotten along?

Asra: I don't know. They would have been nice to you. You might not have liked
them so much.

Thane: ...

Asra: Do you think you'll be able to do any evincing in Nenegi?

Thane: I actually don't know. Nenegi is pretty close to the Erawan border. I
might be able to do something simple. Control a coin flip, maybe.

Asra: What was the evincer program like? Was it anything like your mom taught
you?

Thane: Mom never talked much about evincing. Gheni was way too far from the
Fracture for her to do stuff. She still talked about the spiritual aspect,
though.

Asra: So the training was different?

Thane: Definitely. It was secular, of course. There were only twenty of us, and
the whole thing was supposed to be under wraps. Mostly they just gave us the
enhancements and had us look at optical illusions.

Asra: Why would that do anything?

Thane: Evincing is more than just willing things to happen. You have to believe
they're already happening. So for instance, if you see a pencil in water and it
looks broken because of refraction, you can actually snap it in half.

Asra: That's crazy!

Thane: Yeah. We also rigged dice a lot.

Asra: Why dice? That doesn't make any sense.

Thane: Evincing is basically a glorified placebo effect. Stuff that's based on
luck is easy because you can imagine it happening already. The point is to skew
the odds in your favor.

Asra: Did you ever spar with each other?

Thane: Eventually, yeah. Fighting is way harder because you can use your own
perception to suppress the other person's abilities. I was never great at it.
That, and there was the whole medical discharge thing, so I left early.

Asra: Yeah, what was that about? You've never explained why that happened.

Thane: That's because I don't understand it myself. They kept saying I was sick,
but I felt totally fine. They wouldn't even wait for me to recover.

# An explosion jolts the vehicle and sends the vehicle swerving out of control.

Diego: What the fuck was that?

Asra: Rockets!

Thane: We need to ditch this thing!

Asra: And keep going on foot?

Diego: We don't have a choice. Besides, we can't be far from the city now.

<button class="collapsible">Meeting Vanna</button>
<div class="content">

# Asra leads the group to an apartment.

Thane: Who is this Vanna, anyway?

Asra: She was my parents' supplier here in Nenegi.

Thane: I didn't realize you had those kinds of connections.

Asra: What do you mean? Everyone has a supplier somewhere or other. My dad
wasn't a revolutionary but that doesn't mean we were naive. I've known Vanna
since I was eleven.

Diego: Hold on, I thought your parents died in the Rega Massacre.

Asra: They did. We lived in Nenegi, but my parents commuted to Rega for work
every day.

Diego: Isn't the property value higher here? Why didn't they just live in Rega?

Asra: They thought Nenegi would be safer since it's a military town. They were
right, too.

# Asra knocks, and a woman opens the door.

Vanna: Asra. Didn't think I'd ever see you again. And you've got company, too.

Asra: I wasn't expecting to make it here either. This is my partner Thane and
his uncle Diego. We need some help.

Vanna: I figured. Come on in.

# Vanna waves the trio inside.

Vanna: You scared the shit out of me showing up in those uniforms. For a second
I thought I was getting raided. Right, then. What do you need?

Asra: We're trying to get to the United Territories.

Vanna: Oh, fuck you. It's never easy stuff with you, is it?

Asra: Does that mean you can't help us?

# Vanna sighs.

Vanna: I still owe your parents a favor, don't I? I've got some friends that can
help you. They're on the other side of town, though. 

Asra: It's already past curfew. How-

Vanna: Don't worry about it. You can stay here for the night. We can figure out
the rest in the morning.

Asra: Thank you, Vanna.

Thane: Sure will be nice to sleep on something soft for once.

Diego: Not one for manners, are you?

Vanna: I didn't have to let you stay here in the first place, did I?

Asra: Can you at least tell us where we're going?

# Vanna hands her a torn piece of paper.

Vanna: You're headed toward the west side of town. This is the address.

Asra: Hey, is it okay if we pick up some ammo before we leave?

Vanna: You aren't going to need any weapons. My friends know what they're doing.

Asra: I'm offering you money.

Vanna: Good point. Here's what I've got.

Diego: I've got a bad feeling about this. We're right next to the army base.

Asra: Vanna has a lot of military ties. That's how she gets all her weapons.

Diego: But why would she help us?

Asra: Like she said, she owed my parents a big favor.

Thane: Either way, we're running out of options fast. We either trust Vanna or
wait until we get caught.

Diego: Didn't you say Asra's parents had planned to stow away once? We might be

Thane: I was talking about Asra, you fuck.

Diego: There's nothing we can do for her. She'll be interrogated, then executed.
Our best bet is to head for Rega.

Thane: I can't do that.

Diego: You have to.

Thane: Just go without me.

Diego: Thane, wake up! You're not some kind of superhero! Asra's probably in the
Nenegi Corrections Facility by now. Name one good plan for saving her.

Thane: ...

Diego: Asra's parents wanted to be stowaways. What was their plan?

Thane: Supposedly the ships that run between Chemina and the United Territories
stay too close to the arctic circle for tropical barnacles to get stuck on them,
so that's how you know where to go.

Diego: Assuming you can get on the ship. Still, that's really useful intel.

Thane: Are you sure the United Territories is the best place to go?

Diego: Distance is the key factor here. Every country in Kabel is trying to get
their hands on Cheminan engineers. We can expect political asylum pretty much
anywhere. What's important is we make it to land in one piece.

Thane: Vanna...

Diego: Probably needed the money. Turning in deserters is a lucrative business.
Maybe she knew there was a bounty on our heads, too.

Thane: Fuck. Fuck.

Diego: If I had a choice, I'd give you some time to grieve, but we're really up
against a wall here. Sleep on it. We'll talk more in the morning.

Thane: These are mostly dry. Let's go see what's going on.

Diego: They're raiding the prison... No doubt trying to get their men back.

Thane: Which means...

Diego: If you want to save Asra this is as good a chance as we're ever going to
get.

Thane: Since when did you care about Asra?

Diego: I don't. But I know what she means to you. I know you couldn't forgive
yourself if you passed an opportunity like this.

Thane: That doesn't sound like you at all. Are you trying to make up for turning
your back on my mom?

Diego: No. I don't regret my alliance with Somoza. Phaedra and I were close, but
I put my feelings aside when she was taken away because I wanted to keep you
safe. I knew it was what she would have wanted. Your father did too.

Thane: Still, I've never seen you so eager to go on a suicide mission.

Diego: If this is what's important to you, it doesn't make sense to willfully do
nothing. And like I said, this is our only chance. It's either now or never.

Thane: I... really appreciate that.

Diego: Just keep in mind that if things start to look bad, I'm going to run and

Thane: (in Erawan) Wait! We're not here to hurt anyone! I'm just trying to
rescue a friend!

Prisoner: (in Erawan) You speak Erawan? Who are you?

Jacques: (in Erawan) Who is this Cheminan? Is he with you?

Thane: (in Erawan) Yes. We're together.

Jacques: (in Erawan) I see... How did you make it in here?

Thane: (in Erawan) The prison is under attack from Erawan forces. We took
advantage of the breached defenses.

Jacques: (in Erawan) I thank you for coming to my aid. You may accompany me

Diego: Do you think he's just that good?

Thane: I fought a lot of evincers when I was deployed in Tripsi. Some of them
were good, but none of them were this strong.

Diego: How do you think his abilities reached this point?

Thane: (in Erawan) Jacques, how are you so good at evincing?

Jacques: (in Erawan) I was... enhanced.

Thane: Oh. They gave him Ribatol.

enhancements work in tandem.

Oda: (in Erawan) I expected as much. When your mother defected to Chemina, I was
imprisoned for five years as retribution, as was the rest of the family. When I
was released, I was unable to contact her.

Thane: (in Erawan) How did you end up in Tripsi? I thought my mother was from
Merad.

Oda: (in Erawan) We were from Merad, yes. But our home was sold while we were
incarcerated. When I was released, this was the only place I could afford to go.

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm so sorry.

Oda: (in Erawan) I suppose I should ask what you're doing here in Erawa.

Thane: (in Erawan) We were trying to escape to Debony but we ended up having to
flee here instead. It's a long story.

Oda: (in Erawan) The grass is always greener on the other side, isn't it? My
sister ran to Chemina, and here you are trying to escape.

Thane: (in Erawan) A lot changed since Somoza won the war. At least, that's what
my dad told me. Are you sure you don't want to come with us? I don't mean to be
rude, but it doesn't sound like there's much keeping you here.

Oda: (in Erawan) I would love to, Thane. Trust me, I would. But there's no
country in Kabel that wants to take in an Erawan refugee.

your father - but most people, especially in Tripsi, are much more small-minded.

Thane (in Erawan): I'll be careful. Thank you so much for everything.

Two Weeks Later

# The trio stand on a beach looking at the ocean, though footprints only lead to
# Thane.

Thane: Well, you were right, Diego. We hardly took two steps in the country
before they asked me to work for the Intelligence Bureau. Looks like they're
serious about reducing their dependence on Chemina for technology.

Diego: ...

Thane: You know what's funny? The official story is that Debonese law
enforcement shot us dead. They don't want Somoza to know we're here. Not that
the Cheminan government is going to take their word for it.

Asra: ...

Thane: Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. We're safe. Asra, we're safe! You
don't have to fight anymore. I promised you we'd escape together, didn't I?

Asra: ...

Thane: Now that we can finally focus on each other, I think it's time... time to
start a family. Just like we always wanted.

# The trio are shown in silence for several seconds before Asra and Diego slowly
# fade and disappear.

Distant future: Erawa is invaded partially; Erawans retreat closer toward the
fracture and break the Euclidean space further, to the point where the distance
between the invaded territory and their retreat is practically infinite. No one
is able to penetrate this defense, and so the Erawan people are forgotten.

Chemina is only partly successful in utilizing the Fracture; they can
efficiently mix chemicals (100% percent yield) but are unsuccessful in creating
infinite energy. Debony manages to reproduce nearly all of Chemina's technology,
squelching Chemina's stronghold over technology; however, Chemina remains a
successful exporter and maintains a strong economy.

Debony's technology is used to mine natural resources in Lamenir. This causes
the country to begin developing, and rebel factions begin fighting back against
Debony. In response, Debony develops Pronsi, a drug with extremely potent
withdrawal symptoms leading to death. Pronsi is used to keep Lamenirian slaves
under control, but as slaves develop a tolerance to Pronsi, they require more of
it to stave off withdrawal symptoms. Debony is soon unable to produce enough of
the drug, wiping out nearly the entire continent of Lamenir. Automation is then
employed to mine resources instead.

Debony is the first country to develop radio signals capable of reaching Xeon;
however, Xeon does not have the technology to receive such signals. Chemina
launches the first rocket to land in Xeon.

Artificial intelligence developed in Debony is discovered to have manipulated 
public opinion using social media as well as outright assassinating influential
figures in accordance with its goal of "benefiting humanity." The AI determined
that human susceptibility to oligarchy stems from the obedience of the common
man rather than greed of the few, and aims to change habits inherent to the
masses over the course of nearly 200 years.

## CHAPTER 1: MERAD ##
######################

<button class="collapsible">Panoramic</button>
<div class="content">
# An urban city street fades into view. Civilians scatter as a formation
# of troops march forward.

Twenty years ago, the country of Chemina erupted in civil war. Farid Somoza and
his militia emerged victorious and claimed the nation as their own.

# The screen fades to a timelapse of a skyline, with smoke stacks and
# street lights appearing one at a time.

Somoza saw promise in coal and electrical power, creating an economic powerhouse
from the emerging industries.

Soon after, a campaign was launched to occupy the neighboring territory of Erawa
and use its mystic properties as an energy source.

# Evincers are shown driving back Cheminan soldiers with projectile attacks

The Erawan government considered this exploitation impious, expunging the
occupation and thrusting the two nations into protracted conflict.
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Horseback</button>
<div class="content">

# Four men (Bane, Saito, Biggs, Wedge) ride through a forest on horseback.

Biggs: Can't stand these damned beasts.

Bane: They're the best mounts we have for the terrain. A Vollmer wouldn't last
five minutes in here. Not to mention the engine's too loud for a mission like
this.

Wedge: We haven't seen signs of life in hours, Captain. There's no one around to
hear us.

Bane: Don't sound so disappointed. We haven't even crossed the border into Merad
yet. Saito, do you have the dynamite?

Saito: Yes, sir.

Biggs: Why are we trusting him with that stuff? Wasn't his wife an Erawan?

Bane: Saito is the only explosives expert here. The mission depends on his
expertise. Unless you have a better way of causing an avalanche?

Biggs: ...

Wedge: Captain, ahead!

# As the group reaches a clearing, Wedge points out a scout patrolling the
# mountain pass.

Bane: Wedge, did intel say anything about another way around?

Wedge: No. In fact, they specifically said this was the only way through.

Bane: Alright, men. We'll take this one out, then continue on foot.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Innocents</button>
<div class="content">

Wedge: Fuck, those things are loud.

Bane: You mean the projectiles?

Wedge: Yeah. What makes those rocks so strong?

Saito: They're called flat bombs. You compress an object to a fraction of its
original size, and when you let it expand again, it explodes.

Biggs: Sounds like a bunch of black magic to me.

Bane: Stay on task. The supply base is at the bottom of the hill. The point
serves as an intermediary between manufacturing and the barracks.

Wedge: Wait a minute. If you can turn anything into these flat bombs, what kind
of munitions are they even transporting?

Saito: Probably sharpnel.

Wedge: Shrapnel?

Saito: Not exactly. Sharpnel is pressed into a two dimensional shape to make it
infinitely sharp. You don't even feel it go through you, but it can slice you to
ribbons.

Biggs: Enough of this shit. Let's blow it up.

Wedge: Is there a way to specifically target the base? Looks like a lot of those
are civilian buildings.

Saito: Not the way we're doing it. If we blast the mountainside, we'll wipe out
half the village.

Biggs: So much the better. The only good Erawan is a dead Erawan.

Wedge: Captain?

Bane: Our objective is to destroy the supply base. The briefing says nothing
about minimizing collateral damage.

Saito: ...

Bane: Don't look at me like that. They could have kept the supplies in a more
remote location, but they chose to put them next to civilians. Saito, you know
what to do. Biggs and I will cover you in case someone else comes through.

# Saito marches off, with Wedge following.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Avalanche</button>
<div class="content">

# Saito and Wedge make their way along the mountainside.

Wedge: Biggs sure can be a shithead, yeah?

Saito: I hardly even hear it anymore. Guys like him are common as muck. Though I
appreciate the show of solidarity.

Wedge: What was your wife like? If you don't mind me asking, of course.

Saito: Phaedra was an interesting character. She had a huge rebellious streak,
hence why she came to Chemina in the first place. But she also seemed to have a
strong sense of cultural identity.

Wedge: I take it things went south when the war started?

Saito: Yeah. She was hauled off, probably to some labor camp. No one's heard
from her since.

Wedge: I'm sorry.

# Saito gestures across a vertical slab of wall.

Saito: We need to find a fault line in the rock. That one would work, but we
need something we can reach.

Wedge: What are you talking about? We can get across that, easy.

Saito: You sure about that? If one of us slips, it's all over.

Wedge: If it bugs you so much I can do it myself. Just tell me where to put the
dynamite.

# Saito hands his pack to Wedge, who puts it on and begins to traverse across
# the cliff.

Wedge: Doesn't it bug you that we're burying a bunch of civilians alive?

Saito: Can't let myself think about it too much. My son's back home and if I
ever want to see him again I've gotta keep my head down.

# Wedge reaches a solid ledge and pulls the dynamite out of his pack.

Wedge: I assume it's supposed to go deep in the crack?

Saito: Yeah. Pack it tight, too. How long do you think it'll take you to get
back over to this side?

Wedge: Ten seconds, twenty if I take my time.

Saito: Alright, leave about an arm's length on the fuse and get ready to haul
ass when it lights.

# Just after Wedge lights the fuse, an explosion can be heard in the distance.

Wedge: What was that? Did you leave some of the explosives with Bane?

Saito: No, I-Look out!

# An Erawan soldier pops up from higher up on the cliff and several flat bombs
# toward Wedge. Saito dives for cover. The resulting explosions throw Wedge off
# the ledge and set off the dynamite.

Saito: Shit!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Regroup</button>
<div class="content">

# Biggs exchanges fire with an Erawan soldier. Saito shoots the latter from
# behind. Biggs looks over and notices Saito.

Biggs: Hey! Where's Wedge?

# Saito takes cover beside Biggs.

Saito: An Erawan blasted him off the cliff. What happened to Bane?

Biggs: No clue. There was an ambush and we got separated.

Saito: Fuck. Well, we blew the mountainside. Best thing we can do now is get out
of here as soon as we can.

# A tree shrivels to the size of a twig, revealing an Erawan soldier behind it.
# She tears the twig from the ground and hurls it at Saito and Biggs, who
# scatter.

Biggs: Shit!!

# A massive explosion sounds, kicking up dirt and sending splinters of wood
# everywhere. Biggs lays in a heap, impaled on a branch. The Erawan approaches
# the body to examine it. Saito pulls out a grenade from his pack.

Saito: (It's damaged. Hope it still works.)

# The moment Saito pulls the pin, it explodes and the screen cuts to white.

# Footsteps approach and a shadow can be seen through the hospital curtain.

Saito: (Well I'm not going down without a fight.)

Thane: "I regret to inform you that Saito Belikoff was reported killed in action
while deployed in Merad, Erawa. I hope you can find solace in the knowledge of
his heroic service to the state. I extend my deepest sympathy to you."

Asra: ...

Thane: Think it's true?

Asra: That he died on the battlefield? Maybe. Could've been blown up. Could've
been put down. I've seen both happen pretty often.

Diego: It's time to leave. There's nothing left for us here.

Thane: Now?

Asra: There isn't much for us to wait around for, is there? I'm sure I'll be
deployed soon.

Thane: (She's right. Somoza always keeps one member per household on active duty
so their families can't escape without leaving them behind.)

Diego: Get the books from the cellar. I don't want them laying around after we
leave.

Thane: I feel like we should be talking about-

Diego: There's nothing to talk about. We've discussed this all already. Your
father is dead, and we're fleeing to Debony. That's all there is to it.

<button class="collapsible">Asra: Diego's Apathy</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: How can Diego care so little about his own brother?

Thane: Diego's lost a lot of family. He doesn't have the energy to grieve
anymore. But you shouldn't take that to mean that he doesn't care.

Asra: And what about you?

Thane: I'm sure he cares about me. He just doesn't know how to show it.

Asra: No, I mean how are you feeling?

Thane: Er, sad? In shock? I don't know. I think I need some time to process
everything that's going through my head right now. What are you thinking?

Asra: Is it bad if I say I'm really ready to leave this place?

Thane: No. You're in the military reserve. I'm sure you're thinking how easily
that letter could have been about you instead.

Asra: Actually... I was thinking about how both of our parents are gone now. I
just want to go somewhere else and not think about all of this anymore. But I
feel like that's mentally pushing your dad under the rug.

Thane: I can't expect you to feel the same way about my dad as I do. You barely
knew him. Besides, Diego seems pretty ready to leave, too.

Asra: Heh... Can't believe we finally agree on something.

Diego: What's the matter? Is the vent stuck?

Thane: No, I haven't been down to the cellar yet.

Diego: I told you to get those books. We need to make sure they're gone before
we get raided.

Thane: I was actually going to ask if you were okay with travelling with Asra. I
know you two don't get along.

Diego: Asra's the only one with connections that could get us out of here. Plus
she knows you're half Erawan. If we left her here she'd be taken into custody
and there's no telling what she'd say.

Thane: I doubt Asra would tell them much.

Diego: You really think they wouldn't torture her for information? Bringing her
along is a good precaution.

# With a click, a lightbulb comes to life, illuminating a small basement. The
# old Cheminan flag hangs sideways on the wall. The screen dims for a flashback.

Thane: The old flag looks so creepy.

Saito: That's probably because we're not supposed to own them. People in my
generation prefer it.

Thane: Why?

Saito: It's impartial. When Somoza seized power he made changed it to a mountain
to represent authority.

Thane: That sounds like a stretch.

Saito: You've grown up with the new one your whole life, so I'm sure it looks
normal to you. But the old flag is far less imposing.

# The screen brightens to show Asra behind Thane.

Asra: Hey. Everything alright down here?

Thane: Yeah, what's up?

Asra: You were down here a while. Still bringing this stuff back up?

Thane: It seems like such a waste to burn them.

Asra: Thane... Would you rather be tried as a renegade or traitor? If we get
caught, these are the difference between the gallows and thumbscrews. They have
to go.

Thane: I know. Just... Give me a minute.

Asra: That thing looks ancient.

Thane: It's not that much older than we are. Probably just looks like it
because we never see them anymore.

Asra: I can't believe your dad fought against Somoza's regime back before he
rose to power. Your family's so much more interesting than mine.

# Thane looks down.

Thane: Didn't do them much good, did it? Mom died in the internment camps, and
now Dad's... I'm sorry. It's not like you haven't lost family yourself.

Asra: I'm still grateful, you know. After the Rega Massacre you were all I had
left. There were a lot of people that had nowhere to go. I'm lucky you were
there to take me in. Thank you.

Thane: Asra, I love you. You know I love you. Did you really think I would
leave you on the street?

Asra: I'm still thankful.

<button class="collapsible">Erawa At a Glance</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: Oh, neat. I've always wanted to know more about Erawa. I mean, aside from
what I learned in school.

Thane: Asra, you know what we were taught was-

Asra: I know, I know.

# Asra opens the book.

Asra: "Paranormal phenomena were first observed in Erawa in the sixth century,
though their nature has been closely guarded by the Erawan Empire."

Asra: "Nearly half a millennia passed before Zeke Salow observed that the
magnitude and frequency of these events correlated with their proximity to the
center of the peninsula."

Asra: "Legends of Erawan magicians known as evincers had existed for centuries,
but it wasn't until Salow interviewed defected practitioners that he theorized
the center of Erawa contained what he called a 'subjective fracture in objective
reality,' which enabled the temporary suspension of physical law."

Asra: Whoa. I've never heard anyone refer to it like that. I was always told it
was some kind of electric charge that hovered in the air.

Thane: Yeah. Not even my mom would have described it the way this book does. She
just said the land was sacred.

Asra: "Evincers trained to exploit the Fracture, primarily by manipulating the
natural tundra into a tropical rainforest suitable for agriculture and resource
production, as well as a source of military power during the period of Cheminan
colonization."

Asra: "Erawa's geography is also a topic of debate. According to mythology, its
distinct shape is a result of ancient evincers causing the land to physically
expand out from the Fracture itself, resulting in a perfectly round landmass."

Asra: "However, skeptics argue that such profound influence over the terrain
so far from the center is virtually impossible."

Asra: I guess that does sound kind of far-fetched, but how else could the island
be a perfect circle like that?

Thane: Beats me. I'm not a geophysicist.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Beyond Reality: What the Fracture Means for Modern Society</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: "The exact nature of the Fracture is unknown - reality becomes
increasingly unstable as one approaches it. Within a forty-mile radius, objects
from an observer's imagination begin to materialize, and objects not being
actively observed may dematerialize. Beyond a thirty mile radius, unconscious
eye movements cause earthquakes, and measurement tools begin to malfunction.
Experienced evincers are able to dampen these effects, but there are no
confirmed records of the center having been reached."

Asra: I had no idea the center was so dangerous.

Thane: Yeah, my mom said the whole country is based around how close people live
to the middle. The book explains it more in detail.

Asra: "Because of this, Erawa is divided into five territories shaped like
concentric rings around the center."

Asra: "The ectosphere houses civilians, whose prowess in evincing is typically
modest."

Thane: That's where my mom lived.

Asra: "The endosphere is home to the aristocracy, who wield significantly more
paranormal power."

Asra: "Beyond this layer is the introsphere, which requires specific training
and discipline to enter safely. As a result, only devoted evincers and shaman
are able to live here."

Asra: "The metasphere lies beyond this, and while the effects of the Fracture
are too potent for this area to be permanently inhabitable, it is often a staple
of an evincer's spiritual journey."

Asra: "The cryptosphere is the innermost layer, and is the event horizon for
all human activity. Those that cross this boundary are never seen again."

Asra: "The nature of the center is a topic of fierce debate. Zeke Salow denied
that the itself could have any concrete shape, insisting that complete
subversion of objective reality contradicted the idea of a physical form. He
went on to postulate that a point of purely subjective reality might 'explain
the spark of consciousness that transformed blood-bots into what we call life.'"

Asra: So he's saying subjective experience originated from the Fracture?

Thane: Supposedly. I don't really understand the reasoning behind it.

Asra: It kind of makes sense, but it doesn't account for the connection between
subjective experience and life.

Thane: Well, nothing else does, either.

Asra: Aren't you sort of appealing to ignorance by saying that?

Thane: I'm not trying to saying the theory is right or wrong. I'm just saying it
sounds like as good an explanation as any. But I'm not trying to make any kind
of definitive conclusion and I'm definitely not a philosopher.

<button class="collapsible">A Brief History of Cheminan-Erawan Relations
</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: "Due to the Erawan Empire's reliance on a natural landmark which proved
ineffective outside of the local territory, the state adopted isolationist
policies, much to the detriment of foreign relations."

Thane: "Erawan-Cheminan diplomacy only soured in the wake of Chemina's
industrialization, during which engineers proposed using the Fracture to
construct a perpetual energy machine."

Thane: "This sparked outrage among Erawan activists who considered technological
exploitation of the Fracture heresy, escalating political tensions to an all-out
war."

Asra: Wait, what!? I knew this was a resource war, but I didn't think Somoza was
trying to do anything that crazy!

Thane: Well, you're still a step ahead of everyone that thinks Erawa started the
war.

Asra: Ugh, don't remind me.

Thane: "Although Chemina has no shortage of trade partners following their
emergence as an economic superpower, the possibility of military intervention by
a foreign body is slim."

Thane: "Developed countries have expressed concerns over Chemina's political
instability and the risk of its supreme leader Farid Somoza using the Fracture
to wage a world war, were it ever secured. Consequently, the two nations have
been locked in a stalemate."

Thane: There's a tear on the page. Dad wouldn't read me part of it because he
was afraid I'd talk about it in school. I threw a tantrum and tried to grab it
out of his hand.

Asra: How old were you?

Thane: Five.

Asra: That's pretty young to be lecturing your kid about politics.

Thane: He said all the children's books were "nationalistic garbage" so he read
these to me instead. Even though he had to paraphrase most of it. Kind of weird
to think he's not here to protect the book from me this time.

Asra: You shouldn't think of it that way.

Thane: Why not?

Asra: Those books made you who you are. They've served their purpose. We're only
burning them now because we're making room for a new life - one where we can be
safe from Somoza and this stupid war. If Saito could see you now he'd be proud.

Thane: What makes you say that? You never even knew him.

Asra: Okay. What would he really think of you?

Thane: I guess... He would have been proud. Probably.

Asra: See? This is the best thing we can do right now. Now come over here and
hold me.

# Thane and Asra embrace tightly.

Thane: ... I'm going to miss him.

Asra: I know.

<button class="collapsible">Colonialization in Lamenir</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: "Lamenir has a unique ecological history; it is the only landmass with no
natural hunters. As all of its native meat-eaters have instead adapted to living
as scavengers, aggressive behavior is not observed among wildlife or people."

Thane: "It is the lack of aggression in the Lamenir people for which its
subjugation is often attributed. Indeed, it took less than a century for 10% of
its total population to be enslaved by Debonese colonialists."

Asra: Ugh. Are you sure fleeing to Debony is a good idea?

Thane: We're Cheminan. That's different.

Thane: "In recent years, mining of raw materials in Lamenir has become a staple
in the global economy, supplying Chemina with coal and iron which are refined
into consumer goods and shipped around the globe."

<button class="collapsible">Erawan Scriptures</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: It's in Erawan. The last time anyone could read this was when Mom was
still around.

Asra: I thought you knew Erawan.

Thane: My mom taught me a some growing up, but only spoken. I don't know how to
read at all.

Asra: So why did you keep the scriptures after Phaedra was taken?

Thane: I'm not sure. All of these are banned, but Erawan literature is by far
the biggest liability.

Asra: What about A Brief History? Doesn't it have a lot of contemporary history?

Thane: A Brief History was published in the United Territories. I'm really not
sure how my dad got a hold of it. I'm sure we'll be able to get another copy if
we make it out of here.

# Thane holds the books and flag in a fireplace shovel.

Thane: Does anyone want to look at these one last time?

Diego: ...

# Thane thrusts the books into the fire. Diego leaves the room. After a moment
# of silence, he walks over to Asra.

Asra: Guess the censors won.

Thane: Weren't you just saying we had to get rid of these?

Asra: Yeah. I can only imagine what Diego's thinking, though. Wasn't he a war
correspondent during the Civil War?

Thane: Kind of. Things got... weird.

Asra: You mean when he had to pledge his loyalty to Somoza?

Thane: According to my dad, it was actually earlier than that. Even before
Somoza won, Diego wanted to stay neutral. He mostly just reported numbers and
took photos.

Asra: What about when Phaedra was taken away?

# Thane pauses and looks around.

Thane: By the time Mom was captured, it was clear Somoza was going to win. I
guess Diego wanted to be on the winning side. Even Dad did, although he said it
was only to keep me safe.

Asra: He lost his wife, pledged his loyalty to the man that had her killed, and
after all that Somoza forced him back onto the battlefield. That's so fucked up.

Thane: Asra, I really don't want to think about that right now...

Asra: And now all Diego does is write pro-Somoza propaganda.

Thane: I don't know what to tell you. He's a good writer and it pays the bills.
Neither of us would be here if it weren't for him. That said, a lot of those
books were his. You'd think he'd at least care a little about burning them.

Asra: You said it yourself, didn't you? He did what he had to in order to get
by. We all have feelings but we can't let them get in the way of pragmatism.

# Asra opens the refrigerator.

Asra: Did you want the last brownie?

Thane: All yours.

# Asra pops the treat in her mouth.

Asra: I always thought it was weird how often you and Diego made sweets.

Thane: When I was little, there were several years where we were really poor.
Meat was too expensive so we mostly lived on beans and rice. Sugar was cheap, so
instead of fancy meals we had fancy desserts.

Asra: That's not a bad solution. These things are tasty.

# Diego enters the kitchen and looks at the refrigerator.

Diego: It's a shame we can't bring the appliances with us. We won't get this
kind of modern convenience anywhere else in the world.

Thane: That's funny coming from you. Aren't you always talking about how great
the United Territories is?

Diego: Politically, sure. But we've still got a lock on technology. Just the
refrigerator would cost a small fortune overseas.

Asra: Don't they live like savages?

Diego: Of course not! They've got all your basic necessities - horse and buggy,
ice boxes, that kind of stuff. Just like when you were a baby. How do you not
know that?

Asra: Teachers at school always said the rest of the world lives in straw huts
without running water. Saying it aloud it does sound pretty naive.

Diego: Disgusting.

Thane: Come on, Diego. Asra and I went to the same school for a while. You must
have known they were feeding us lies.

Diego: At least you had your father to tell you how much of it was bullshit.
Where are the real history books when you need them?

Diego: Doesn't matter. You should have one, even if it's just for suppressive
fire.

Thane: You just fucking shot two officers. What...

Diego: It was either that or let them haul you away to some black site.

Thane: Where did these guns even come from?

Diego: Your father was a bit of a kleptomaniac. When it was clear Somoza was
winning the war, he started collecting weapons from fallen enemies. Once the war
was over his service weapon was taken but he was able to hide these.

Thane: I had no idea. Wait, why weren't they in the book cellar?

Diego: Hell if I know. Saito hid them in the bedroom. Pretty reckless
considering what would have happened if we'd ever been raided, but I guess
keeping them handy finally paid off.

Asra: Looks like we're leaving earlier than expected. Good thing we're already
packed.

Thane: What the hell did they want from me?

Diego: Who knows? My guess is they double-checked Saito's family records when he
died and realized you were half Erawan. No use worrying about it now. But we
really do have to get out of here.

Thane: Just to be clear, we're headed for Nenegi, right?

Asra: Yeah. That's where Vanna is. She'll help us escape.

# Asra opens the door.

Asra: We really need to go.

Diego: Shit. It's after curfew. Look, in case things go to shit-

Asra: They already have.

Diego: Brilliant observation. Anyway, we can't afford to have a shootout. If you
see a patrol unit, go around. If you can't, take them out before they know
you're there. Don't let them shoot back. Period.

Thane: Is this how the Civil War was fought?

Diego: More or less. Somoza had a huge advantage in firepower, so rebels like
your father had to be a little more creative.

Asra: Sounds more underhanded than anything.

Diego: "Underhanded" is a pejorative used to give standing armies an advantage
over civilian resistance. Fighting honorably strips the average man of the only
advantage he has against an organized force.

Asra: I thought we weren't trying to start a fight.

Diego: We're not. This isn't like what you're used to in Erawa. We're going to
be running and hiding. But if that fails, we can't take chances, either. I'm not
going to gamble my life away picking a firefight.

<button class="collapsible">Cargo Inspection</button>

# The train slows and comes to a halt.

Thane: Is this Chalt?

Asra: Has to be. The Capital Spire is right over there, see?

# Asra points into the distance. Diego smells the air.

Diego: Yeah, definitely Chalt.

Asra: You know the city?

Diego: Chalt was a big tipping point in the Civil War. Conquering it was a huge
feat, and one of the biggest reasons Somoza saw fit to make it the new capital.
Hence the spire.

Asra: Either that or he's compensating for something.

Thane: I don't doubt that. You know what they say about the Debonese.

Asra: Wait, Somoza is Debonese?

Diego: Half Debonese, half Cheminan. He grew up in Nenegi, but he had a lot of
connections back in Debony.

Asra: I didn't know any of that... How did he become so powerful?

Thane: How do you think? He invested in factories and started making guns.

Diego: You're leaving out a big part of what actually happened. In order to make
those investments, Somoza needed money and support. Most of that support came
from Debony's public sector. Unofficially, of course.

Asra: No way. Did they know they were funding a civil war?

Diego: Oh yes, and it's exactly what they wanted to happen, too. And it wasn't
just weapons. People that hung around Somoza started getting all kinds of nice
bonuses. That's how he got all the manpower behind his campaign.

Asra: But if Debony is backing Somoza, why do we want to escape there?

Diego: They used to support him. Back before the war, Debony was anxious to get
its hands on our technology.

Asra: Not much has changed, huh?

Diego: Exactly. Ever since we discovered electricity, they've been pushing
nonstop for a way to start manufacturing their own goods. Somoza was supposed to
seize control of Chemina, then send all the research and prototypes back home.

Asra: Let me guess. After the war ended, he wanted it all to himself.

Thane: So why didn't Debony just go to war with us?

Diego: Hard to say. For one, it would be a complete bloodbath. They have a
large enough military to overpower us, but our artillery would make it a very
costly fight. The other reason is it's still in their interest to trade with us.

Asra: I thought the Cheminan military was the strongest in the world.

Diego: Obvious propaganda.

# A bright light shines in Asra's face. She shrinks back into the shadows.

Thane: Fuck, what was that?

Diego: Shit. Cargo inspection. Time to go.

this anymore.

Diego: Chalt was practically torn to shreds during the Civil War. I spent a lot
of time snapping photos in this area and got to know a lot of locals. Including
the mob.

Thane: That still doesn't explain a whole lot.

Diego: Gangs in Chalt are well-connected, and there's a strong network for
organized crime. Escorts were always a good entry point for things like drugs
and weapons, probably because they had the most visibility.

Asra: Isn't the job of any prostitute to be a good entry point?

Thane: Nice.

Diego: The point is, Chalt hasn't changed.

<div class="content">

# The escort leads them into an apartment complex. She knocks on a door.

Merchant: Who is it?

Fayth: Hey Malik, it's Fayth. I've got some people looking for gear.

# The door opens as much as the door chain allows, with a man behind it.

Malik: What do you need?

Thane: Police uniforms. For him.

# Thane gestures to Diego.

Malik: Hmph... Big dude. I'm not sure I've got anything that'll fit him, but
I'll see what I can find. What do you need 'em for, anyway?

Asra: Just playing dress-up.

Malik: Bit old for that, aren't we?

Asra: It's a fetish.

Diego: Hey-

Malik: Whatever. Not my business. Give me a second.

# Malik closes the door.

Thane: Do you always struggle to find clothes that fit?

Diego: Not always, but it's pretty common. Really asinine how poorly stocked
most places are.

Asra: Give them a break. You are a pretty big guy.

Diego: No I'm not. It's that the rest of you are all so damned small. Your whole
generation grew up with refrigerators and ovens and hardly any food to put in
them. It's not that I'm big. You kids are just malnourished.

# The door opens again. Behind it, Malik is holding a uniform.

Malik: This is the largest size I have. Twenty lauves, if you don't mind.

Asra: That's absurd! Fayth, how many blowjobs could we get for that?

Fayth: Six.

Malik: Fayth, that is not helpful. Do you want these or not?

Diego: We don't even know if they fit yet.

Malik: If they don't fit, you'll get you your money back.

Diego: ...

Thane: Doesn't leave us much choice, does it?

# Diego exchanges money for the uniform and changes into it.

Diego: A bit tight, but it's better than nothing.

Malik: Is there anything else you three are interested in? I just got a shipment
of Ribatol if that tickles your fancy.

Diego: Ribatol? Isn't that the name of the drug they gave you in the evincer
program?

Thane: Yeah. It's a hallucinogen. What about it?

Asra: Wait, what? Thane...

Thane: What? Quit looking at me like that.

Asra: Sorry. It's just... hallucinogens are... concerning.

Thane: Why?

Asra: A few years back, one of my friends started experimenting with mushrooms.
Something happened to him where he started having relapses, even after he'd
stopped taking them.

Diego: Ah, that. What you're referring to is called hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder - HPPD for short. In most cases you have to be using
psychedelics really often for it to show up.

Thane: I must be lucky then. They gave us a lot of that stuff, but I never
noticed anything unusual after the initial effects wore off.

Asra: I can't believe they would take a risk like that in the first place. Why
would they want to drug you to begin with?

Thane: Evincing is all about changing your perception to make it reality.
Ribatol is supposed to make it easier for your perceptions to change. What it's
actually supposed to do is cause hallucinations that you can control.

Asra: Did it work?

Thane: Hard to tell. Some people seemed to get better at evincing when using it,
but not me.

Diego: ...

Asra: I guess that makes sense. Still, it's fucked up that they're using
Cheminan civilians to test stuff like that.

Diego: They probably tested it on prisoners of war before they started drugging
our own people.

Asra: Oh. Well in that case it's all good.

Malik: Are you buying anything or not?

# A shop opens.

<button class="collapsible">Squatting</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: We should find a place to settle down for the night. We can't keep going
around past curfew. We'll get ourselves killed.

Diego: Why not stay here?

Thane: I don't even know where this is.

Diego: This is the old uptown area. It's not a great neighborhood, and my guess
is it only got worse after the war ended. We should stay put until morning.

Asra: This place seems as good a place as any. Let's try the stairwell and see
if we can stay by the roof.

# The three climb just past the top floor.

Thane: I can feel a slight breeze here, but I don't think anyone's going to come
up and bother us.

# Thane lays a blanket out and the three of them huddle together on the landing.
# Diego lays down and closes his eyes.

Asra: Thane?

Thane: Yeah, what's going on?

Asra: I don't want to fight anymore.

Thane: I know. Neither do I. This will be over soon, I promise.

Asra: How do you and Diego do it without it affecting you?

Thane: It does affect us. At least, it affects me. I feel empty and scared every
time I shoot this thing.

Asra: But that's the thing. It's like you can keep going and you still hate
doing it. I don't know why I'm growing to enjoy it so quickly. I feel like I'm
losing control of myself.

Thane: I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do.

# Asra dumps the contents of her pack. Dog tags, photographs, and locks of hair
# tumble out.

Asra: Am I weird for keeping these?

# Thane picks up a dog tag.

Thane: Are these... the people we killed?

Asra: I thought these would help me see them as human beings, and maybe I
wouldn't be so eager to pull the trigger. But in the heat of the moment, I just
shoot anyway.

Thane: I know you don't want to keep fighting, but you shouldn't do this to
yourself. You're only going to feel worse. And if you do start choking up in the
middle of a fight you could get all of us killed.

Asra: ... Okay. You're right.

# Asra begins to tremble. Thane leans her against him and kisses her forehead.

Thane: Shh... Relax.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Leaving Chalt</button>
<div class="content">

# The trio wakes up on the stairwell.

Thane: So, what's the plan for today?

Diego: That's a damn good question. After the debacle at the trainyard there's
no way we can go back and hitch a ride to Nenegi. Our best bet might be going by
horseback.

Asra: What about a car?

Diego: We don't have the money for that. Plus, none of us can drive.

Thane: Horseback sounds good to me. Let's head downtown and see what we can
find.

Diego: I haven't been here in quite some time, but there used to be tons of
stables in old town. We're probably better off looking there first.

Thane: Alright, we can start there. You think anyone in Chalt is going to be
looking for us yet?

Asra: Doubtful. As far as they're concerned, we're still in Gheni.

Diego: I second that. There's more than enough crime in Chalt to keep the cops
busy.

Asra: Wouldn't Somoza want the capital to be... I don't know, nicer?

Diego: It's plenty nice by all the government buildings and tourist attractions.
But the rest of the city is a literal dump. And so long as Somoza can sweep the
ugly bits under the rug, he's fine keeping it that way.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Breaking News: Remembrance of the Rega Massacre
</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: "Today marks the one year anniversary of the Rega Massacre, a tragic
event in which 413 civilians and 588 soldiers were killed in an unprovoked
assault on Cheminan territory."

Asra: Hard to believe it's been a year already.

Thane: "General Jaromir reminds our brave soldiers that the enemy is ruthless
and underhanded, and that it is tragedies such as these that demand our troops
remain steadfast in protecting our great nation."

Diego: General Jaromir should be chopped up and thrown to the wolves.

Asra: I'm not a fan of the war either, but don't you think that's a bit harsh?
Things might not be perfect, but our army is the only thing preventing a full-on
invasion. Things would be a lot worse if we didn't have a strong military.

Diego: I don't disagree. I'm saying that it's disgusting for them to run these
kinds of stories. I don't understand why you're getting behind a patriotic
narrative like this.

Asra: My parents died that day! If anyone has a reason to support our troops, I
do.

Diego: That's exactly my point. Jaromir isn't from Rega; he's from Chalt. He
doesn't give a shit about your parents, he's just using the massacre as leverage
so people will keep fighting.

Asra: War or no war, it is the anniversary of the massacre. It's no surprise
they're running a story on it. What are we supposed to do, just say nothing and
forget about everyone that died?

Diego: No. I'm saying that we shouldn't be standing on the bodies of your
parents while they rattle off war propaganda.

Asra: I really didn't expect that coming from you. You've written countless
articles that take the exact same angle.

Diego: It's not as though I enjoy writing that garbage. There were superiors
breathing down my neck, and I had to do something to support Thane. And you, in
case you forgot.

Asra: ...

Thane: Are you two done?

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Trolley</button>
<div class="content">

# The trio approach a stop where passengers are boarding a trolley.

Soldier: Because our great leader is holding a rally at the square, the only
routes in service today are those running to or from the downtown area!

Diego: Just what we needed. Another detour. Whatever, we'll get horses after
the event is over.

Thane: At least it's a rally. Better than having to watch a public execution.

Diego: I couldn't agree less.

# The trio board.

Asra: I'll bet a captive audience does wonders for Somoza's self-esteem.

Thane: Keep your voice down! Do you want to get us all killed?

Asra: ...

# The trio boards a trolley and heads toward the square.

Asra: There might be stables downtown, too. It's worth looking around while
we're there. Might save us some time.

Diego: Downtown Chalt is the most modernized neighborhood in the country, maybe
the most modern on Kabel. My guess is almost everyone there uses automobiles.
But you're right. It's worth looking.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Rally</button>
<div class="content">

# Somoza stands at a podium, delivering a speech.

Farid Somoza: "On this day, one year ago, Cleric Gael Mancini saw fit to send an
army to our homeland, slaughtering hundreds of innocents. This is a travesty of
justice that our people must never forget. But neither shall we forget the
bravery shown by those who laid down their lives to protect their neighbors.

"I consider tragedies such as these to show the inherent difference between us.
In Erawa, I see barbaric acts taken against non-combatants. I see the cowardice
of an enemy that cannot fight with honor. But in our people, I see courage -
the courage to stand against such an enemy, to defend our homeland, and most
importantly, to rebuild and prosper anew amidst the threat we now face.

"When I first came to lead Chemina, I was faced with a great deal of opposition.
I saw the looming threat of Erawa, but soft-hearted apologists assured me that
such concerns were unnecessary. Many were blind to the enemy which threatened
to destroy us from within. It is chilling to imagine the scope of destruction we
undoubtedly would have faced had such naivety been the prevailing mentality when
Erawa first invaded. Our children may well be speaking Erawan in school, or
forced to adopt their occult practices.

"Remember, comrades, that Erawa is the antithesis of all that we stand for. They
are a people dependent upon their archaic witchcraft. Their society is one of
stagnation, and for all their history, they have nothing to show for the time
they have had to civilize themselves.

"As for Chemina... Progress and cooperation are the foundation of our nation,
and while the fight ahead of us may be long and arduous, I encourage you also to
look at how far we have come. Why, just within my lifetime, I have seen the
genesis of motor vehicles and aircraft, the proliferation of electrical power in
the form of various appliances, and a country that has become ever more
interconnected thanks to railroads and the telegraph.

"For this reason I have certainty that our triumph over Erawa is inevitable. As
our country marches onward and our technology becomes ever more advanced, they
sit and twiddle their thumbs. Erawa is much the same as it has always been, and
is doomed to remain as such.

"It is also for this reason that I can be confident that we are righteous in our
conflict. For not only have we transformed ourselves, the entirety of Kabel has
been transformed by the fruits of our innovation! We toil not just to benefit
ourselves, but to the benefit of all humanity. Standing before me I do not see
engineers and soldiers, but pioneers of a new age and guardians of the future."

Thane: Oh, shit.

Asra: What is it?

Thane: On my left. I know that guy. We were squadmates. I have to get out of
here before he recognizes me.

Asra: Do you think he knows the authorities are looking for you?

Diego: Doesn't matter. We shouldn't risk hanging around here. There's a bar on
the top floor of Knox Tower. We'll be out of sight, plus we can look around to
see if there are any stables downtown while we're up there.

# The trio slink off toward the tower.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Iron Sights</button>
<div class="content">

Receptionist: Are you here for Knox Bar and Grill? You can take the elevator to
the top floor.

Diego: We'll take the stairs, thanks.

Receptionist: If you insist.

# The trio enters the stairwell of the and begin climbing.

Thane: What's that all about?

Diego: I don't like elevators.

Thane: It's kind of nice that no one questions you when you're in uniform.

Asra: Not to mention we all look fiendishly attractive.

Thane: Wait. This building has sixty floors. Are we really taking the stairs
this whole way?

Diego: Like I said, I really don't like elevators. Besides, we could use the
privacy.

Asra: Do you think Somoza's right about us moving into a new age?

Diego: I think change is coming. But I also think Somoza's biting off more than
he can chew. If he keeps trying to trade technology like gold and spices it's
going to blow up in his face.

Thane: Why? He's been leader my whole life and I've never seen something so much
as threaten his rule.

Diego: It's not about politics, it's about the technology itself. It's taken all
of 40 years to go from steam engines to biplanes. It's great for him in the
short-term, but eventually the market is going to grow until it overtakes him.

Asra: Yeah, except Somoza controls the market, too.

Diego: His official position is supreme leader. Dictator or not, the title
weighs him down. He's not in a position to cope with the changes technology is
bringing.

Asra: You said yourself Chemina has a lock on technology. If Somoza won't be in
control of the economy, who will be?

Diego: Countries are already starting to reverse engineer our things. It's only
a matter of time before Chemina has competitors, and when that happens, Somoza
will start losing his footing.

Thane: So anyone that wants to rule Kabel will have to do it through the
economy. But what's to say Somoza still won't be that person?

Diego: Have you heard him talk? Somoza's too stubborn to survive the changes
he's causing. If you look at how rapidly technology spreads, it makes sense. I'm
not sure any government can handle those kinds of changes.

Asra: That makes even less sense. You still haven't said who's going to pick up
the slack and benefit the most from all this.

Diego: If I had to guess, I'd say pirates. Governments are anchored to their
land, but technology can go anywhere its blueprints can. Anyone that controls
intellectual property is going to fill that vacuum.

# Thane approaches a window, then waves them over.

Thane: Hey, come look at this.

# Somoza, still speaking, is visible through the window.

Diego: ... Oh.

Asra: Holy shit. We could totally hit him from here.

Thane: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

Asra: What are the odds of an opportunity like this?

Diego: Virtually nothing. I'm having trouble believing what I'm seeing. This
feels too good to be true. Do we really want to though?

Thane: It would be insane to pass up an opportunity like this.

Diego: Thane, listen to me closely. If you shoot him, all of us will die. I'm
not saying it's wrong, but you need to understand that.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Asra: Assassination</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: This fucker started the war that killed my parents. He sent both of yours
away to die. He has to pay.

Thane: You realize there's no way we could get away with this, right?

Asra: This is going to sound impulsive, but I don't care. We're just three
people, Thane. What are our lives worth compared to the millions that are
suffering because of him?

Thane: Now you're starting to sound like the revolutionary. I didn't think you
would be so eager to do this.

Asra: My family might have been misinformed but we weren't naive. I was taught
in school to love Somoza, but we were also afraid. There's only so much you can
fear someone before you start to resent them. I want him dead.

Thane: So do I, but I also want to make it out of this country alive. I want to
have a future with you. Isn't that what you wanted, too?

Asra: What if someone else had the same chance to kill him, but didn't? What if
they said the same thing you did? I want to escape with you, Thane. So, so
badly. But we shouldn't let this slip through our fingers. We can't.

Thane: Weren't you just saying you were afraid of how bloodthirsty you were
becoming? Are you sure this is what you want?

Asra: This is different. I'm not the one holding the gun. And I've wanted Somoza
dead long before we decided we wanted to go to Debony. Maybe you don't believe
me, but I'm actually calm right now.

Thane: But... Would you really rather have your vengeance than make it over the
border? Aren't you more important than that? Aren't I?

Asra: I don't want to bully you into getting yourself killed based on my whim.
If I were a good enough shot I'd shoot him myself and take full responsibility,
but I'm not. And it's not right for me to make the decision for all of us.

Thane: You didn't answer my question. Does killing him mean that much to you?

Asra: I... don't know. I do love you. But what if we don't shoot him and we
still get caught trying to flee? What if we pass up this chance and it's all for
nothing?

Thane: What if I shoot and miss? There's always a chance something could go
wrong.

Asra: We have a really good position. I don't think you'll miss.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Diego: Assassination</button>
<div class="content">

Diego: I'd think twice before pulling that trigger. You know his son is just
going to take over, right? Besides, his regime is doomed to fall even without
our help.

Thane: Yeah, but-

Diego: But what? What's done is done. You can't bring back the people that are
already dead, and killing Somoza now isn't going to help anyone either. Changing
the world is more complicated than shooting bad guys.

Thane: He still deserves to die.

Diego: Sure he does. But are you going to throw all of our lives away based on
who deserves what?

Thane: Are you telling me not to shoot him?

Diego: ... No. I don't ever want to tell someone the story about how my nephew
almost killed Farid Somoza until I talked him out of it. I could never live with
myself.

Thane: What do you want, then?

Diego: I'm staying neutral.

Thane: You haven't changed at all since the Civil War, have you? Is this the
tail end of your journalistic objectivity?

Diego: Thane, my integrity went out the window after your mom was taken away. I
don't believe in that kind of stuff anymore.

Thane: ...

Diego: My actions at that time were rooted in self-preservation. This is
different. I'm letting you make this choice yourself, even if it kills me.

Thane: You're just putting your life in my hands that easily? Does this mean
anything to you?

Diego: Of course. This is extremely important to me, but both choices have
merit. That's why I'm fine with whatever you choose to do. Just make sure that
whatever you do, it's for a good reason.

# Diego, Asra, and Thane ride past trees and smokestacks in the Vollmer Armored
# Car.

Thane: I always wanted to see your hometown, but I never imagined it like this.

Asra: Really? Ever since the day I met you I dreamed of taking you back with me
in a three-ton Vollmer.

Thane: You know what I mean. I wish I'd gotten to know your parents.

# Asra smiles weakly.

Asra: Stop romanticizing it like that, Thane. I already told you they were...
provincial. If they'd known I was seeing some half-Erawan guy...

Thane: What if they didn't know? Do you think we would have gotten along?

Asra: I don't know. They would have been nice to you. You might not have liked
them so much.

Thane: ...

Asra: Hey, random question.

Thane: Shoot.

Asra: Do you think you'll be able to do any evincing in Nenegi?

Thane: I actually don't know. Nenegi is pretty close to the Erawan border. I
might be able to do something simple. Control a coin flip, maybe.

Asra: What was the evincer program like? Was it anything like what your mom
taught you?

Thane: Mom never talked much about evincing. Gheni was way too far from the
Fracture for her to do stuff, so she never taught me anything. She still talked
about the spiritual aspect, though.

Asra: So the training was different?

Thane: Definitely. It was secular, of course. There were only twenty of us, and
the whole thing was supposed to be under wraps. Mostly they just gave us the
enhancements and started us off by showing us optical illusions.

Asra: Why would that do anything?

Thane: Evincing is more than just willing things to happen. You have to believe
they're already happening. So for instance, if you see a pencil in a glass of
water and it looks broken because of refraction, you can actually snap it in
half.

Asra: That's crazy!

Thane: Yeah. We also rigged dice a lot.

Asra: Why dice? That doesn't make any sense.

Thane: Evincing is kind of like a glorified placebo effect. Stuff that's based
on luck is easy because you can imagine it happening already. The point is to
skew the odds in your favor.

Asra: Did you ever spar with each other?

Thane: Eventually, yeah. Fighting is way harder because you can use your own
perception to suppress the other person's abilities. Most of the time you just
cancel each other out. I was never great at it. That, and there was the whole
medical discharge thing, so I left early.

Asra: Yeah, what was that about? You've never explained why that happened.

Thane: That's because I don't understand it myself. They kept saying I was sick,
but I felt totally fine. They wouldn't even wait for me to recover.

# Asra points into the distance.

Asra: We're coming up on Nenegi. If we get too close in the Vollmer, someone's
bound to see us. We should ditch this thing and keep going on foot.

Diego: There's probably a patrol waiting to cut us off when we get there. It was
pretty clear we were headed for Nenegi when we made it outside city limits.

Asra: Nenegi is surrounded by rocky terrain. It's one of the reasons it's a
military town, since it's naturally fortified. There are only two main roads
into the city, and they're going to have tight security regardless.

Diego: You said main roads. Are there other ways in?

Asra: Yes. I took the liberty of driving through some of the rockier terrain.
There are some less direct routes into the city through here. Mostly gangs use
them to smuggle in contraband.

Diego: And border security doesn't know about it?

Asra: They don't care. Troops trade on the black market at least as much as any
of the civilians, so they're happy to turn a blind eye.

# Asra parks the Vollmer and motions for the others to get out.

<button class="collapsible">Breaking News: Invention of Television</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: "Researchers use amplitude-modulated frequencies to transmit images via
cathode ray tubes. Visual broadcast media is expected to reach the market later
this year."

Diego: I didn't understand half of that.

Asra: I'm surprised. Aren't you the one that's always saying education is worse
than it used to be?

Diego: It is. People used to know history. They used to know how to think. Now
it's just about trying to find the next science prodigy.

Asra: That's not fair. Who are you to decide what people should be learning? I
don't see you inventing anything.

Thane: Asra, don't-

Diego: It's not about what I've invented, or what anyone's invented for that
matter. You two grow up practically illiterate and completely ignorant of your
own history, and then you think engineering is the only thing worth knowing.

Asra: Not everyone has to be like you, Diego! Different people-

Diego: Everyone needs to know why things are the way they are right now! You
can't raise a whole generation of engineers to be subservient workers that shirk
their collective responsibility as citizens and then expect a revolution.

Asra: What do you know about collective responsibility? Your own brother risked
his life in the Civil War and all you did was stand on the sidelines and watch!

Diego: You have no right to lecture me about a war that happened before you were
born.

Thane: Both of you shut up!

Asra: ...

Thane: You can argue as much as you want when we reach Debony, but until then,
put the drama aside and stay focused.

<div class="content">

# Asra leads the group to an apartment.

Thane: Who is this Vanna, anyway?

Asra: She was my parents' supplier here in Nenegi.

Thane: I didn't realize you had those kinds of connections.

Asra: What do you mean? Everyone has a supplier somewhere or other. My dad
wasn't a revolutionary but that doesn't mean we were naive. I've known Vanna
since I was eleven.

Diego: Hold on, I thought your parents died in the Rega Massacre.

Asra: They did. We lived in Nenegi, but my parents commuted to Rega for work
every day.

Diego: Isn't the property value higher here? Why didn't they just live in Rega?

Asra: They thought Nenegi would be safer since it's a military town. I guess
they were right, too.

Thane: I thought you didn't have anywhere to go. If you're so close to Vanna,
why not move in with her?

Asra: Vanna's pleasant enough to be around, but she's not exactly generous.
Besides, I wanted to be closer with you anyway.

# Asra knocks, and a woman opens the door.

Vanna: Asra. Didn't think I'd ever see you again. And you've got company, too.

Asra: I wasn't expecting to make it here either. This is my partner Thane and
his uncle Diego. We need some help.

Vanna: Figures. Come in.

# Vanna waves the trio inside.

Vanna: You scared the shit out of me showing up in those uniforms. For a second
I thought I was getting raided. Right, then. What do you need?

Asra: We're trying to get to the United Territories.

Vanna: Oh, fuck off. It's never the easy stuff with you, is it?

Asra: Does that mean you can't help us?

# Vanna sighs.

Vanna: I still owe your parents a favor, don't I? I've got some friends that can
help you. They're on the other side of town, though. 

Asra: It's already past curfew. How-

Vanna: Don't worry about it. You can stay here for the night. I'll give you
directions in the morning.

Asra: Thank you, Vanna.

Thane: Sure will be nice to sleep on something soft for once.

Thane: Ugh, is it morning already?

Vanna: I want you guys out of here in five minutes.

# Thane shakes Asra awake. Diego gets up slowly.

Diego: Not one for manners, huh?

Vanna: I didn't have to let you stay here in the first place, did I? I'm sorry.
Mornings make me grumpy.

Asra: Can you at least tell us where we're going?

# Vanna hands her a torn piece of paper.

Vanna: You're headed toward the west side of town. This is the address.

Asra: Hey, is it okay if we pick up some ammo before we leave?

Vanna: You aren't going to need any weapons. My friends know what they're doing.

Asra: I'm offering you money.

Vanna: Good point. Here's what I've got.

# A shop opens.

Diego: Are you sure we can trust Vanna?

Asra: I've known her for over ten years. If we can't trust her, I have no idea
who we'd go to for help.

Diego: I've got a bad feeling about this. We're right next to the army base.

Asra: Vanna has a lot of military ties. That's how she stocked most of her
shop.

Diego: But why would she help us?

Asra: Like she said, she owed my parents a big favor.

Thane: Either way, we're running out of options fast. We either trust Vanna or
keep floundering until we get caught.

# The trio passes a wanted poster for the three of them. Diego tears it down
# and crumples it.

Diego: Does it strike you as odd that Vanna didn't even ask about us being on
the run?

Thane: Not really. The fiasco in Chalt was recent. Even if she kept up with the
news, she might not have known anything happened.

Asra: Vanna watches the news like a hawk. She's always exchanging telegraphs
with her connections. There's no way she wouldn't know about something like
this.

Thane: And she didn't think to warn us?

Asra: Diego, give me that poster.

# Diego hands over the paper, which Asra straightens.

Asra: Someone increased the bounty on our heads tenfold. Vanna set us up.

Thane: Are you sure? You said you and Vanna had a lot of history. It doesn't
sound like she'd-

Asra: I'm sure. Vanna doesn't pass up this kind of money. We need to get out of
here.

# The trio turns around and begins to retreat, but officers spring up from all
# directions.

Soldier: Drop your weapons!

Asra: Vanna, I'm going to fucking kill you.

Thane: We'll have to stay close for warmth.

Diego: Hmph.

# Thane cozies up to Diego awkwardly.

Thane: So what happens now?

Diego: Didn't you say Asra's parents had planned to stow away once? We might be
able to do that.

Thane: I'm talking about Asra, you fuck.

Diego: Are you asking me to tell you what you already know? There's nothing we
can do for her. She'll be interrogated, then executed. Our best bet is to head
for Rega.

Thane: I can't do that.

Diego: You have to.

Thane: Then go without me.

Diego: Thane, wake up! You're not some kind of superhero! Asra's probably in the
Nenegi Corrections Facility by now. Name one good plan for saving her.

Thane: ...

Diego: Asra's parents wanted to be stowaways. What was their plan?

Thane: Supposedly the ships that run between Chemina and the United Territories
stay too close to the arctic circle for tropical barnacles to get stuck on them,
so that's how you know where to go.

Diego: Assuming you can get on the ship. Still, it's a start.

Thane: Are you sure the United Territories is the best place to go?

Diego: Distance is the key factor here. Every country in Kabel is trying to get
their hands on Cheminan engineers. We can expect political asylum pretty much
anywhere. What's important is we make it to land in one piece.

Thane: But I mean, does it even matter if we escape? Debony's just going to milk
all my technical know-how and treat me like a pawn. What difference does it make
if we cogs in a machine either way?

Diego: Debony won't force you to fight, they won't care that you're half-Erawan,
and you'll be compensated far better than you are here. That enough reasons for
you?

Thane: Yeah. I guess you're right.

Diego: I know things look shitty now, but you can't let that distract you from
the fact that it really will be better there. I don't use this word often, but
try to have a little faith. At the very least, it's better than doing nothing.

Thane: Vanna...

Diego: Needed the money. Turning in deserters is a lucrative business. That
would be especially true in our case.

Thane: Fuck. Fuck.

Diego: If I had a choice, I'd give you some time to grieve, but we're really up
against a wall here. Get some sleep. We'll talk more in the morning.

Diego: An Erawan attack in Nenegi? That's unheard of.

# Thane picks up his clothes and puts them on.

Thane: Mostly dry. Let's go see what's going on.

# Diego gets dressed and they hike toward the noise.

Diego: They're raiding the prison... No doubt trying to get their men back.

Thane: Which means...

Diego: If you want to save Asra this is as good a chance as we're ever going to
get. Honestly, between this and catching Somoza with his pants down, we've had
more than our share of freak occurrences.

Thane: Since when did you care about Asra?

Diego: I don't. But I know what she means to you. I know you won't forgive
yourself if you pass an opportunity like this.

Thane: That doesn't sound like you at all. Are you trying to make up for turning
your back on my mom?

Diego: No. I don't regret my alliance with Somoza. Phaedra and I were close, but
I put my feelings aside when she was taken away because I wanted to keep you
safe. I knew it was what she would have wanted. Your father did too.

Thane: Still, I've never seen you so eager to go on a suicide mission.

Diego: If this is what's important to you, it doesn't make sense to wilfully do
nothing. And like I said, this is our only chance. It's either now or never.

Thane: I... really appreciate that.

Diego: If things start to look bad, I'm going to run and escape with my life. I
suggest you do the same.

as the former general was sworn in."

Diego: What did I tell you? It's still the same country.

Thane: ... It really didn't matter, did it?

Diego: Well, he is dead. If that's what you wanted, I suppose you have something
to be happy about.

Thane: But... the war isn't over. People are still going to die.

Diego: If peace were as easy as killing the bad guy, it would have happened a
long time ago.

Thane: Do you still think I shouldn't have done it?

Diego: Quite the opposite. I always wanted Somoza dead, I just figured it would
be suicide to kill him. But against all odds, we pulled it off and got away
scot-free. "Miracle" isn't a strong enough word to describe what happened.

Thane: What do you mean, scot-free!? Asra was-

Diego: Asra was captured because Vanna set us up. We still made it out of Chalt
in one piece.

Thane: I never really thought about that.

Diego: Thane, has it really not hit you yet? Farid Somoza is responsible for the
deaths of millions of people, including both of your parents. You killed him and
lived to tell the tale. Let that sink in for a minute.

Thane: ...

Diego: I'm not trying to celebrate anything early. Making it to Rega is going to
be a hell of a lot harder, and there's no guarantee we'll make it onto a ship,
and the war with Erawa still isn't over, but you did something that most people
would have called impossible.

function, I'm getting us both out of here. This is dangerous enough without you
losing your mind.

# Thane blinks hard.

Thane: No. I can do this. I have to.

Diego: What is our first objective? Repeat it back to me.

factories, prison blocks, warehouses... That small building just below us looks
like it could contain prisoners. Might be a good place to start.

could hit them one after the other. If we don't find Asra by then... Well, we
can cross that bridge when we come to it.

Thane: (in Erawan) Erawa is trying to free prisoners of war. We took advantage
of the opening.

Jacques: (in Erawan) To find your friend.

Thane: (in Erawan) Yes.

Jacques: (in Erawan) I was captured along with one of my squadmates. I intend to
find him. Given that we're both trying to rescue comrades, I am willing to

Jacques: (in Erawan) I was given enhancements.

Flint: You sure you don't want company? I guarantee it'll be a lot safer.

Thane: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm going to go now.

Flint: Alright. Take care of yourself.

# Flint starts walking away.

Thane: That guy gives me the fucking creeps.

Asra: We're really lucky he didn't know who we were.

Thane: Maybe he does. Keep an eye out in case he decides to follow us.

# The trio make their way into an abandoned house.

Diego: You really think we'll find anything in here?

Thane: I doubt we'll find food, but at the very least it should make for decent
shelter. I don't have the energy to do anything else today.

# Thane enters the kitchen and sees fresh fruit on the table.

Asra: This stuff can't be more than a few days old.

Thane: Maybe we should-

Old Man: (in Erawan) Who are you!?

Thane: What-

Old Man: (in Erawan) Cheminan! Haven't you taken enough from us already?

Thane: (in Erawan) Wait! I'm not-

# The man grabs a knife from the counter. It shrinks to less than an inch in
# length before he throws it.

Old Man: (in Erawan) Die!

# Thane reflexively raises his hand and deflects the knife, which bounces back
# toward the man.

Thane: No!

Old Man: (in Erawan) How-

# Thane tackles Asra to the floor just as it explodes violently.

Asra: What... just happened?

# The trio get back up. The old man is dead, a shard of metal embedded in his
# forehead.

Thane: He tried to kill us with a flat bomb... And I was able to delay the
explosion by an extra second.

Asra: I didn't know you could do that.

Thane: I... I did it without thinking.

# As Diego surveys the man's wounds, a teenage boy enters the kitchen from
# another room.

Boy: (in Erawan) Dad!

# The boy looks at Thane, then screams and starts attacking him with his fists.

Boy: (in Erawan) Murderer! Why won't you people just leave us alone!?

# Thane tries to push the boy away. The boy persists, and Thane fires warning
# shots from his gun, causing the boy to fall silent, then flee the house.

Diego: ... Oh.

# Thane sits down on the floor, leaning on the wall, and breaks down crying.

Thane: I can't take this anymore!

# Asra kneels behind him and squeezes his hand. Diego leans against the wall and
# looks away.

Thane: Why did any of this have to happen?

Asra: This wasn't your fault, Thane.

Thane: I don't know if I can believe that.

Diego: If it makes you feel any better, he probably would have died even if you
hadn't deflected it.

Thane: None of this would have happened if we'd just gone somewhere else!

# The three of them sit in silence for several minutes until Thane stops crying.

Diego: Do most civilians know how to make flat bombs?

Thane: I don't think so. Mom said villagers never used evincing to fight.

Diego: Then how...?

Thane: Fuck if I know. Most people in Erawa know at least a few things.

# Thane leans over the man.

Thane: I'm so sorry. You never asked for this. I didn't mean to...

Asra: We'll find somewhere else to stay. Come on.

Thane: I can't. What if-

Asra: It's okay. We'll find an empty house, and we'll make sure this doesn't
happen again.

Thane: What's the point?

# Asra turns Thane to look at her.

Asra: I love you, and we're going to make it to Debony together, and we're going
to be able to live out the rest of our lives in peace. That's the point. What
just happened was terrible and I wish it hadn't happened. But that's the point.

# The trio enter another old house, Thane holding a flashlight.

Diego: I don't like this.

Thane: Neither do I, but we don't have a choice. We need a place to spend the
night.

# As they make their way through a hall, a door opens and a woman steps out.

Thane: (in Erawan) Please, wait! We're not trying to hurt anyone!

Woman: (in Erawan) What's that? Who are you?

Thane: (in Erawan) We're just trying to survive the night. I didn't realize
someone was living here, I'm so sorry. Please just let us leave.

Woman: (in Erawan) If you need a place to stay, why not here? You'll be safe for
the night.

Thane: (in Erawan) ... What?

Woman: (in Erawan) That's what you're looking for, isn't it?

Thane: (in Erawan) Yes, but-

Oda: (in Erawan) Then make yourself at home. There's too few of us left here in
Tripsi for us not to take care of each other.

Thane: (in Erawan) But... we're Cheminan.

Oda: (in Erawan) Doesn't make much difference to me. If you wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead already, right? I'm Oda, by the way. Oda Stutz.

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm Thane Belikoff.

# Diego gestures to himself, then to Asra.

Diego: I'm Diego Belikoff. This is Asra Sacco.

Oda: (in Erawan) Belikoff? I don't suppose you know a man named Saito by any
chance?

Thane: (in Erawan) What...? That's my father!

Oda: (in Erawan) I see. I suppose that would make Phaedra Stutz your mother?

Thane: (in Erawan) Who... are you?

Oda: (in Erawan) I'm Phaedra's older sister. How is your mother doing?

Diego: I heard her say Phaedra. How does this woman know your parents?

Thane: She's... your sister-in-law. (in Erawan) My mother was... taken away. I
haven't seen her since I was little.

Oda: (in Erawan) I expected as much. When your mother defected to Chemina, I was
imprisoned for five years as punishment, as was the rest of the family. When I
was released, I had no way to contact her.

Thane: (in Erawan) How did you end up in Tripsi? I thought my mother was from
Merad.

Oda: (in Erawan) We were from Merad, yes. But our home was given to another
family while we were incarcerated. When I was released, this was the only place
I could afford to go. The rest of my family was... less fortunate.

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm so sorry.

Oda: (in Erawan) I suppose I should ask what you're doing here in Erawa.

Thane: (in Erawan) We were trying to escape to Debony but we got pushed here
instead. It's a long story.

Oda: (in Erawan) The grass is always greener on the other side, isn't it? My
sister ran to Chemina, and here you are trying to escape, too.

Thane: (in Erawan) A lot changed since Somoza won the war. At least, that's what
my dad told me. Are you sure you don't want to come with us? I don't mean to be
rude, but it doesn't sound like there's much keeping you here.

Oda: (in Erawan) I would love to, Thane. Trust me, I would. But there's no
country in Kabel that wants to take in an Erawan refugee. Besides, it looks like
you've had quite the adventure. I doubt I'm in good enough health for that sort
of thing.

Diego: She's got a point. Even I'm going to have a hard time convincing the
Debonese government to let me stay, seeing as I'm not an engineer. I might have
to be a confectioner.

Thane: ...

Oda: (in Erawan) Get some rest. It sounds like you still have a ways to go.

Oda: (in Erawan) Where are you headed?

Thane: (in Erawan) Back toward the border. I'm trying to get to Rega.

Oda: (in Erawan) You should try and avoid any Erawans you come across. Phaedra
was always very open to new people - I think that's why she fell in love with
your father - but most people, especially in Tripsi, are much more small-minded.

Thane (in Erawan): Yeah, we ran into... Actually, it's not important. I'll be
careful. Thank you so much for everything.

Oda (in Erawan): No, thank you. It's good to know I have a nephew, and that he's

Thane: We're all Cheminan, aren't we? We can just say we were taken prisoner and
escaped.

Diego: So what happens after that? Cheminan or not, we're dead as soon as they
identify us.

Thane: I doubt they're looking for us in Rega. It should be easy enough to lie.
Or we could just bribe them.

Diego: That's not going to work.

Thane: Actually... I just had an idea.

Asra: What are you doing?

Thane: Have you ever seen those illusions where you stare at something for ten

Asra: Yeah, I think it's called iconic memory? Wait, does that mean you can use
evincing to disguise yourself?

Thane: Only one way to find out.

# Thane stares at the photo of Saito, then into the mirror. After a few tries,

Thane: Hopefully this lasts long enough for us to cross the border. But what
about you two?

Asra: Wait, I know!

# Asra digs around in her pack and pulls out two photographs taken from fallen

Asra: Guess it wasn't such a bad idea to hold onto these, huh?

Thane: Alright, stand still.

# Thane repeats the process with both Asra and Diego.

Diego: Did it work?

Thane: Yes, but try not to look at each other. Your expectations might undo the

Diego: Won't we change back when border security looks at us?

Thane: They don't know what you're supposed to look like, so their expectations
aren't going to do anything.

# The trio finally approach the checkpoint and are greeted by border security.

Thane: "Last week, defector Sara Cosac was detained on charges of illegal
emigration, draft evasion, resisting arrest, and unauthorized possession of a
firearm. She is scheduled to be publicly executed in Chalt tomorrow morning."

Asra: Shit... That could have been us.

Thane: Yeah. I really can't believe how lucky we've been this whole time.

Diego: I have to agree. The odds have been against us from the start, and
they've only gotten worse.

Asra: I'm just throwing this out there, but if we'd really been lucky, I
wouldn't have been captured in the first place.

Thane: Well if you want to take that angle... If we'd been lucky, Diego wouldn't
have had to kill the officers that tried to drag me away.

Diego: Point taken.

# The trio pass a man, who approaches Thane.

Man: Excuse me, do you have a moment?

Diego: As a matter of fact, we do not.

Siegfried: My name is Siegfried. I am here on behalf of a group of people like
yourselves - young men and women committed to change.

Thane: I'm not interested.

Siegfried: Really? I think you're just the type-

Thane: I said I'm not interested. Leave us alone.

Siegfried: I know who you are, Thane Belikoff.

Thane: Choose your next words carefully.

Siegfried: Calm down. If I had any intention of turning you in, do you really
think I would be confronting you like this? I know you are armed and dangerous,
yet still I approach you alone and unarmed. Do I look like I want a fight?

Diego: Why are you looking for us here? Why are you looking for us at all?

Siegfried: We have ears in many places.

Siegfried: You must understand why the assassins of Farid Somoza would draw my
interest, especially given that you were able to destroy the airship deployed
immediately after. Moreover...

Siegfried: The ability to defeat and commandeer a Vollmer on foot is not likely
to escape our interest. I decided to track you down because we need people like
you on our side.

Thane: Everything we did was out of self-preservation and opportunism. Stop
trying to recruit us into your little group. We're not interested. Fuck off.

Siegfried: You're in Rega because you're planning to stow away on a cargo ship,
yes?

Thane: ...

Siegfried: The port is closed until tomorrow. You and I both know this. I can
offer you shelter for the night. All I ask in return is that you listen to what
I have to say.

Asra: Why should we trust you?

Siegfried: That again? I already told you, I wouldn't need to approach you like
this if I were after your bounties. Besides, the police are after me, too.

Thane: ...

Siegfried: Not in the mood to talk? That's fine. I'm going back to our base. If
you're interested, follow.

# The trio follow Siegfried into the ruins of the Rega massacre.

Thane: All this destruction...

Asra: Mom... Dad...

Siegfried: You're Asra, yes? I was not aware you had family here. I'm sorry for
your loss. Are you from Rega?

Asra: Nenegi, actuaully. My parents worked here.

Siegfried: I see.

Thane: Why wouldn't they just build a memorial over the ruins? This is...

Diego: Depressing? I imagine that's on purpose. These shelled buildings serve to
remind people of the constant threat. It keeps people afraid.

# Siegfried leads the group past a locked grated door and into the sewer system.

Diego: Your organization is stationed here?

Siegfried: Yes. You are surprised?

Thane: Why a sewer?

Siegfried: The sewers allow us access to much of the city while keeping us out
of sight. And since we're under the ruins, we can escape to street level without
being immediately surrounded.

Asra: If we're lucky, we might be on the water before sunset.

Diego: It's about time we started travelling before curfew. This whole adventure
has been a train wreck.

Asra: Thane, I know it's kind of early to talk about this but...

Thane: Yes?

Asra: When we escape, would you want things to be... more serious?

Thane: You mean marriage?

Asra: Yeah. I don't want to rush you if you aren't ready yet.

Thane: No, I'm ready. If we make it to Debony, I think... I think it would make
sense.

Asra: If that isn't motivation, I don't know what is.

# Siegfried approaches the group.

Siegfried: Sleep well?

Thane: Well enough. 

Siegfried: As I said earlier, I would have you listen to my offer. A small price
to pay for a safe place to sleep, I think.

Asra: Are you a terrorist organization?

Siegfried: To the Somoza regime, perhaps. We aim to disrupt. But more important
is the vision all of us share for a better Chemina.

Diego: Which is?

Siegfried: We are sick of this pointless war. We are sick of Somoza's draconic
labor camps, kin punishment, public execution, and constant surveillance. We aim
to overthrow the regime and give the country back to its people.

Diego: You guys must have a death wish.

Siegfried: Perhaps. But I would rather die fighting for myself and my loved ones
than for a dictator that makes us fight people who have not even wronged us.

Asra: I understand why you're doing this. I felt the same way for a long time.
But I've started to imagine how easy it would be to just run away instead. What
use are vengeance or freedom if you're not around to enjoy them?

Thane: I'm surprised.

Asra: Yeah, so am I. Up until now, the idea of escape seemed like some far away
pipe dream. It was easy to disregard something so abstract and uncertain. But
now we've come this far, it really feels like we'd be sacrificing something.

Siegfried: Have the two of you made the same decision as well?

Diego: My priority was always to leave the country as soon as possible. That has
not changed, nor do I expect it to.

Thane: Likewise.

Siegfried: I will ask one last time. The three of you have the ability to be a
part of something larger than yourselves, to fight back when before you could
only run and hide. So far you have fought only for your own survival. This is a
chance to liberate everyone. Is it that hard to see the bigger picture?

Asra: My neighbor ratted me out to claim a bounty on my head. If it weren't for
Thane I'd have been executed. Your idealism is charming, but I'd rather protect
people I know I can trust. And starting a revolution isn't my idea of protecting
anyone.

Thane: Same goes for me. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I have too
much to live for to gamble it away like this. So if you don't mind, the three of 
us will be on our way now.

Siegfried: Most unfortunate. I hoped it would not come to this, but you leave me
no other choice. This is my final offer. You join us, or we turn you in.

# Siegfried draws a pistol.

Asra: Is this some kind of bad joke? The police are hunting you, too.

Siegfried: Not all of us.

Diego: And you think we won't expose your little operation if you do?

Siegfried: Not if we hand them your corpses. Besides, even if we let you go, you
might still expose us under torture.

Thane: You're making a big mistake.

Siegfried: The mistake is yours. I'm offering the choice between fighting an
abusive dictatorship and dying here fighting men and women that only want the
same thing you do. It is not too late to reconsider your options.

Diego: You're not as charming as you think you are. But if I'm not in a position
to refuse, I won't try.

Siegfried: I knew you would come to your senses. Come with me. I'd like you to
meet some of our friends.

# As Siegfried half turns toward the door, Asra body checks and shoots him
# multiple times in the chest. Rapid footsteps and shouting echo through the
# sewers as people come to investigate.

Asra: What an idiot.

Diego: I'm getting really sick of this.

Asra: We need to find a cargo ship without tropical barnacles on it. Those are
the ones going to Debony.

Thane: Got it. Let's take a look around.

Diego: This probably doesn't need to be said, but I'm going to remind you two
anyway. We really can't afford to be recognized here. There's no room for error
if we're seen. These ports shut down at the first sign of conflict, and if that
happens we're shit out of luck.

Thane: I'll be careful, but to be honest I'm not too concerned about being
hunted down at this point. The government is probably more focused on the attack
on Nenegi. I'm sure a lot of their manpower has been redirected to the border.

Asra: If they're still cleaning up the mess the Erawans made, they might not
even know I've escaped yet.

Thane: They almost certainly don't know all three of us are still travelling
together. So if they're looking at all, it's probably for a group of two.

Asra: Still, Diego's right. We do need to be extra careful if we're going to
make it onto one of these ships.

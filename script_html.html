Spend Rega chapter delving into Asra's character arc. Have her overcome her fear
of becoming addicted to killing (in other words, 'fake' development.)

Symptoms of psychosis:
depression			difficulty concentrating	hallucinations
anxiety				suspiciousness				delusions
social withdrawal	disorganized speech
suicide				poor sleep

Thane should show more signs of distress in Tripsi/Rega
	* Thane is initially distrustful of Oda?
	* Thane almost screws up getting through the border?
	* Inconsistencies in rebels in Rega?
	* Thane accidentally kills someone in Rega?
	
Rega Rebellion - fake conspiracies revealed
	* "Rega Massacre was an inside job"
	* "Nenegi assault was an inside job, Chemina paid Erawan mercenaries"
	* "Rega rebels were running a sting operation"
Thane and Dagan are sent on a mission with another rebel. Because it's a suicide
mission, Thane kills the rebel rather than risk his life and tries to return to
the rebel base.
(2 part mission so they enter and exit via separate routes?)
Thane can't make it back to base through sewers, thinks he was set up.

Thane encounters a man claiming to be part of a rebellion to overthrow Somoza.
He offers Thane a place to sleep, in a rebel base located in the sewers. When he
wakes up, the man tries to convince Thane to join him, then threatens him when
he declines. Thane reluctantly accepts, and is sent to destroy a power plant.
While in the sewer tunnels, Thane betrays and kills a rebel sent with him. The
end of the tunnel leads directly to a military compound, leading Thane to
suspect he was set up from the beginning. He retreats back to the rebel base but
is forced to fight his way out.

The industrial revolution began in the remote country of Chemina, only to be
hijacked by military dictator Farid Somoza. In the following decades, the first
world's struggle to reduce its dependence on foreign technology has created a
vacuum which Cheminan refugees are only too happy to fill. Follow Thane and his
family as they fight tooth and nail to flee the country.

Chapter 1

Two countries, Chemina and Erawa, are locked in a war. Chemina is in its early
stages of industrialization, whereas Erawa’s military is derived from
supernatural phenomena wielded by its people.

A four-man fireteam from Chemina marches through Erawan territory, intent on
sabotaging a military supply base. Their stealth is compromised and fighting
ensues. One of the soldiers, Saito, is injured by a defective grenade. He wakes
up in a medical tent, only to be euthanized.

Chapter 2

Saito’s son, Thane, reads a military death letter. His uncle (Dagan) and
girlfriend (Asra) decide the three of them must flee the country now that they
are no longer waiting for Saito to come home.

Thane burns the family collection of banned history books. Before departing,
they are accosted by military police as they attempt to leave. Dagan kills the
officers in self-defense and they sneak onto a freight train to seek help from
Asra’s friend Vanna.

Chapter 3

The train is stopped in Chalt for a cargo inspection, forcing the group to find
shelter in the city. Following the death of the officers, there is now a warrant
for their arrest. It is revealed that Thane was formerly part of a super soldier
program where he was administered hallucinogenic drugs.

The group goes downtown, hoping to rent horses to ride to Nenegi. They are
recognized and a chase ensues, forcing a violent confrontation. Thane
commandeers an armored vehicle and the group narrowly escapes.

Chapter 4

The group reaches Nenegi and seeks help from Vanna. Vanna attempts to turn them
into the police for their bounties, forcing them to flee. In the ensuing
conflict, Asra is captured, while Thane and Dagan dive into a stream and take
shelter in a nearby forest. Dagan suggests stowing away on a ship to escape to
the country of Debony now that Vanna has betrayed them.

Thane and Dagan wake to the sound of a civil defense siren to find Nenegi’s main
prison complex under attack from Erawan forces. They infiltrate the compound
intent on finding and rescuing Asra. Dagan is severely injured, but they manage
to regroup and escape. However, while retreating they are forced into the Erawan
city of Tripsi.

Chapter 5

The group seeks shelter in Tripsi and finds a middle-aged woman who turns out to
be Thane’s maternal aunt. She offers help, but warns Thane of Erawan gangs that
may attack them as they attempt to leave. The group encounters the gang but
manages to subdue them. Afterward, they sneak across the border to the port city
of Rega.

Chapter 6

The group is confronted by revolutionaries who offer them shelter and ask for
help in overthrowing the Cheminan government. When Thane refuses, they threaten
to turn him in and fighting ensues. The group manages to escape, then heads for
the port and sneaks onto a ship.

Chapter 7

The group awakens to find the ship docked in Debony and attempts to leave. The
crew of the ship attempts to arrest them, but they fights their way off of the
ship and into the custody of Debonese police, who offer them political asylum.

Later, as Thane reminisces about his escape, it is revealed that Asra and Dagan
did not actually escape to Debony with him, but were instead hallucinations
caused by the effects of the experiments done on Thane. Asra was never rescued
from the prison, and Dagan was killed by the injury he sustained during the
attempted rescue.

Distant future: Erawa is invaded partially; Erawans retreat closer toward the
fracture and break the Euclidean space further, to the point where the distance
between the invaded territory and their retreat is practically infinite. No one
is able to penetrate this defense, and so the Erawan people are forgotten.

Chemina is only partly successful in utilizing the Fracture; they can
efficiently mix chemicals (100% percent yield) but are unsuccessful in creating
infinite energy. Debony manages to reproduce nearly all of Chemina's technology,
squelching Chemina's stronghold over technology; however, Chemina remains a
successful exporter and maintains a strong economy.

Debony's technology is used to mine natural resources in Lamenir. This causes
the country to begin developing, and rebel factions begin fighting back against
Debony. In response, Debony develops Pronsi, a drug with extremely potent
withdrawal symptoms leading to death. Pronsi is used to keep Lamenirian slaves
under control, but as slaves develop a tolerance to Pronsi, they require more of
it to stave off withdrawal symptoms. Debony is soon unable to produce enough of
the drug, wiping out nearly the entire continent of Lamenir. Automation is then
employed to mine resources instead.

During the chaos in Lamenir, the territory of Lebre fights a losing battle to
remain independent. Politicians ultimately acquiesce and agree to quell the
revolutionaries - their former allies - in the remainder of Lamenir. Several
military units desert and defect in rebellion.

Debony is the first country to develop radio signals capable of reaching Xeon;
however, Xeon does not have the technology to receive such signals. Chemina
launches the first rocket to land in Xeon.

Artificial intelligence developed in Debony is discovered to have manipulated 
public opinion using social media as well as outright assassinating influential
figures in accordance with its goal of "benefiting humanity." The AI determined
that human susceptibility to oligarchy stems from the obedience of the common
man rather than greed of the few, and aims to change habits inherent to the
masses over the course of nearly 200 years.

This artificial intelligence is challenged by a collective superintelligence
formed from prehistoric coral reef, which manipulates underground volcanos to
destroy strategic sections of the AI's architecture.

[A teacher stands at the front of a classroom, lecturing.]

Teacher: Construction on Chemina's railway system exploded in the early 1890s,
and its growth continued to accelerate until Erawa invaded in 1907. We're
fortunate that Somoza took office before then. If he hadn't weeded out the
Erawan spies, we'd surely have lost the war before it began.

Child 1: Why did Erawa attack us?

Teacher: Take a look at what was happening at the time. In the past century we'd
invented the steam engine and electrical power. Erawa's culture is extremely
regressive. They rely on witchcraft because it's the only thing they've ever
known. Our society was changing rapidly, and it scared them. They hate our way
of life and want to destroy it.

Keola: Teacher?

Teacher: Yes?

Keola: My mom said Somoza was the one that started the war. Is that true?

Teacher: That was certainly the narrative the Erawan Department of Intelligence
told. As I was saying earlier, Erawa had planted a lot of spies. Many of them
had infiltrated the media to spread misinformation and rile up Erawan
sympathizers.

Keola: ... I see.

Teacher: Oh, and Keola? I'd like to speak with you after class.

Keola: Yes, teacher.

Teacher: Anyway, our railroads are still growing, just not as fast. The same can
be said of our other developments. For instance, the war effort has forced the
government to cut funding for medical research. Of course, if Erawa had its way,
we'd still be using crystal healing and leeches. Chemina leads the future. So
you can see how important it is for us to support our troops.

<button class="collapsible">Horseback</button>
<div class="content">

[Four men ride through a jungle on horseback.]

Biggs: Can't stand these damned beasts. I've found corpses that didn't smell
this bad.

Wedge: You know, Biggs, I've found corpses that smelled better than you, too.

Bane: They're the best mounts we have for the mission. An armored vehicle just
isn't going to cut it on this terrain. Not to mention how much racket the
engine would make if we rolled through here in a Vollmer.

Wedge: We haven't seen signs of life in hours, Captain. There's no one around to
hear us.

Bane: Don't sound so disappointed. We haven't even crossed the border into Merad
yet.

[Wedge's horse inadvertently splashes muddy water on Saito.]

Bane: Shit. Saito, that didn't splash the dynamite, did it?

Saito: No, sir. Still dry.

Biggs: I still don't get why we're trusting him with that stuff. Wasn't his
wife an Erawan?

Saito: (Does he really have to bring that up every chance he gets?)

Bane: Saito is the only explosives expert here. The mission depends on his
expertise. Unless you have a better way of causing an avalanche?

Biggs: ...

Wedge: Captain, ahead!

[The group stops and looks in the direction Wedge is pointing.]

Saito: I only see one. If he's got any squadmates, they're lurking just out of
sight.

Bane: Wedge, did intel say anything about another way around?

Wedge: No, sir. One way in, one way out.

Bane: Alright, men. We'll take this one out, then continue on foot.

<button class="collapsible">Innocents</button>
<div class="content">

[After a skirmish with Erawan soldiers.]

Wedge: Fuck, those things are loud. What are they?

Saito: The projectiles are called flat bombs. You compress an object to a
fraction of its original size, and when you let it expand again, it explodes.
It's the same principle behind the launchers.

Biggs: Sounds like a bunch of black magic to me.

Saito: You're not far off. You have to trick your own perception to make it
shrink. Whether or not it works depends on-

Biggs: Don't care.

Bane: Stay on task. The supply base is at the bottom of the hill. The point
serves as an intermediary between manufacturing and the barracks.

Wedge: Wait, why do they need munitions? Can't they just make these "flat bombs"
whenever they need one?

Saito: Probably sharpnel.

Wedge: Shrapnel?

Saito: Sharp-nel. Two-dimensional blades. Razor sharp. You can't even feel it go
through you, but the stuff cuts to the bone. Takes time to prepare, though, so
they mass-produce it ahead of time.

Biggs: Enough of this shit. Let's blow it up.

Wedge: Is there a way to specifically target the base? Looks like a lot of those
are civilian buildings.

Saito: Not the way we're doing it. If we blast the mountainside, we'll wipe out
half the village.

Biggs: So much the better. Only good Erawan's a dead Erawan.

Wedge: Captain?

Bane: The briefing says nothing about minimizing collateral damage. Our
objective is to destroy the supply base, so that's what we're going to do.

Saito: (Guess I shouldn't be surprised.)

Bane: Don't look at me like that. The supply base is in the middle of the
village for a purpose. They're banking on people like you shying away from
civilian casualties... and holding their own people hostage in the process.

Saito: You think proving them wrong is that important? There must be hundreds of
people down there.

Bane: (Sigh) Leave the storybook idealism at the door. This isn't a fairytale.
It's war. Biggs and I will cover you in case someone else comes through.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Avalanche</button>
<div class="content">

[Saito and Wedge walk along the edge of the cliff.]

Wedge: Can he do that? Those poor people are about to get buried alive!
alive?

Saito: No use arguing over it. My son's back home and if I ever want to see him
again I've gotta keep my head down.

[Beat]

Wedge: Biggs sure can be a shithead, yeah?

Saito: I hardly even hear it anymore. Why should I care what he thinks?

Wedge: What was your wife like? If you don't mind me asking, of course.

Saito: Strong-willed. Huge rebellious streak. It's one of the reasons she came
to Chemina in the first place. But she still had a lot of respect for where she
came from, if that makes sense.

Wedge: I take it things went south when the war started?

Saito: Yeah. She was hauled off, probably to some labor camp in Nenegi. Haven't
heard from her since.

Wedge: I'm sorry.

[Beat]

Saito: We need to find a hole along a fault line in the rock, otherwise it's not
going to bring anything down. That one would work if we could reach it.

[Saito gestures to a long, vertical crack, several meters away horizontally.]

Wedge: What are you talking about? That's an easy traverse.

Saito: You sure about that? One slip and you'd be toast. And this fuse is only
good for 30 seconds.

Wedge: Watch and learn, my friend.

[Wedge traverses to a small landing and prepares to light the fuse. Gunshots
can be heard in the distance.]

Saito: Hey, Wedge? I heard gunshots!

Wedge: Then cover me. I'm a little busy, if you couldn't-

Saito: Look out!

[An Erawan higher on the cliff fires off several flat bombs, blasting Wedge off
the cliff.]

Saito: Shit!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Regroup</button>
<div class="content">

[Saito encounters Biggs trading fire with an Erawan from behind cover. Saito
shoots the distracted Erawan and joins Biggs behind cover.]

Saito: (Never thought I'd be happy to see Biggs.)

Biggs: Hey! Where's Wedge?

Saito: He...

[Saito looks down and shakes his head.]

Biggs: Fuck.

Saito: What about Bane?

Biggs: No clue. There was an ambush and we got separated.

Saito: Great. Well, we blew the mountainside. Let's get the fuck out of here.

[A tree shrivels to the size of a twig, revealing a child soldier, who uproots
it and throws it at them.]

Biggs: Shit!!

[Saito is sent flying and Biggs is impaled on a branch. The Erawan inspects
Biggs' body. Saito draws a grenade, pulls the pin, but it explodes instantly.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Infirmary</button>
<div class="content">

Saito: (Fuck this hurts! I can barely think. What happened? My grenade... went
off in my hand? And then...? I'm... in a hospital bed. And that tapping...
Someone's using a telegraph.)

???: ... R HAND. 3RD DEG BURNS ON ARM. TRAUM BRAIN INJ. MULT FRACTURES.

???: CAN RECOVER?

???: STABLE, BUT FULL RECOVERY IMPOSSIBLE.

???: CAN HE FIGHT?

???: NO.

???: PUT HIM DOWN.

[Beat]

???: ARE YOU SURE?

???: YES.

Saito: (Is this how it ends? Mauled by a defective grenade and euthanized in a
medical tent? No, they can't be talking about me.) 

[Footsteps approach the hospital curtain.]

Saito: (Well I'm not going down without a fight.)

[Saito feigns sleep. When the nurse swabs his arm, he jerks up and strikes her
in the chest. Blood gushes from Saito's right arm, only a stump. He screams.]

Saito: My... hand!?

[The nurse finishes injecting Saito and he collapses.]

<button class="collapsible">Death Letter</button>
<div class="content">

[A young couple sits at the foot of a bed, holding a letter. Standing at the
window looking out is a middle-aged man.]

Thane: "I regret to inform you that Saito Belikoff was reported killed in action
while deployed in Merad, Erawa. I hope you can find solace in the knowledge of
his heroic service to the state. I extend my deepest sympathy to you."

[Beat]

Thane: Dad...

Asra: I'm so sorry, Thane.

Thane: No. This can't... why?

[Asra takes Thane's hand and squeezes it.]

Dagan: It's time to leave. There's nothing left for us here.

Thane: But... what if they're lying?

Dagan: So what if they are? Maybe he's dead. Maybe he was captured. Maybe they
fucking euthanized him. Asra said they've started doing that when soldiers can't
fight anymore. It doesn't matter what happened. He's not coming home, and that
means it's time to pack up.

Thane: ... Why now?

Asra: If we wait too long I'll be next. Wasn't Saito deployed right after you
came back? How long were you here before he left?

Thane: I don't know, a week? It was asinine. He was gone before I could finish 
unpacking.

Asra: (Sigh) Typical Somoza bullshit. No way to leave without abandoning
family.

Dagan: Which is precisely why we're need to get a move on. Get the books from 
the cellar. I don't want them laying around after we leave. The last thing we
need is for them to find a bunch of contraband if we're caught jumping the
border.

Thane: I feel like we should be talking about-

Dagan: There's nothing to talk about. We've discussed this all already. Your
father is dead, and we're going to Debony. I was ready for this letter to come
the moment he was drafted, so let's get moving.

Asra: Whoa, that is completely uncalled for! Can't you give him five fucking
minutes to grieve?

Thane: It's okay, Asra. He's right.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Asra: Dagan's Apathy</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra follows Thane down the stairs from the bedroom.]

Asra: How can Dagan care so little about his own brother?

Thane: Dagan's lost a lot of family. He doesn't have the energy to grieve
anymore. But you shouldn't take that to mean that he doesn't care.

Asra: And what about you? Are you going to be okay?

Thane: I don't know. I'm kind of in shock. It's gonna take some time to process
everything that's going through my head right now. What about you?

Asra: Is it bad if I say I'm really ready to leave this place?

Thane: No. You're in the military reserve. I'm sure you're thinking how easily
that letter could have been about you instead.

Asra: Kind of? Mostly I just want to forget about my whole life here and start
over. But I feel like that's mentally pushing your dad under the rug.

Thane: I can't expect you to feel the same way about my dad as I do. You barely
knew him. Besides, Dagan seems pretty ready to leave, too.

Asra: Guess that's one thing we have in common.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Dagan: Traveling Together</button>
<div class="content">

[Dagan comes downstairs and sees Thane.]

Dagan: What's the matter? Is the vent stuck?

Thane: No, I haven't been down to the cellar yet.

Dagan: I told you to get those books. We need to make sure they're gone before
we leave.

[Asra sighs and leaves the room.]

Thane: Are you going to be okay traveling with Asra? I don't want any drama
while we're on the road.

Dagan: What's the alternative, leave her behind? Asra's the only one with
connections that could get us out of here. Plus she knows you're half Erawan.
If she stays she'll be taken into custody, and then what?

Thane: She wouldn't tell them anything.

Dagan: I won't sicken you with horror stories, but you should really know
better. We're bringing her along. For her sake and yours.

Thane: That wasn't my... Ugh, nevermind.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Book Cellar</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane moves a grate covering a vent in the living room, revealing a crawl
space. He crawls through, emerging in a cellar. Against one wall is a
bookshelf. On the other, the old Cheminan flag. Transparent images of Thane
and Saito appear before him.]

Thane: (Why do you keep this old thing? You do realize what would happen if
someone found it down here, right?)

Saito: (Of course. That's why it's here.)

Thane: (Do you have a death wish or something?)

Saito: (You're not old enough to remember just how little is left from before
Somoza's reign. They burned every flag they could get their hands on. It's a
miracle this one survived. So no, I'm not getting rid of it.)

Thane: (It's a miracle you survived, too. Isn't that worth something?)

Saito: (The mantra is always "Chemina leads the future." No one admits that it
burns the past in the process. If you knew how things used to be, you would
understand.)

Asra: Whoa. This place is crazy.

Thane: Ah!

[The transparent figures vanish.]

Asra: Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. You were down here a while. Still
bringing this stuff back up?

Thane: Yeah, but... It seems like such a waste to burn them.

Asra: Would you rather be tried as a renegade or traitor? If we get caught,
these are the difference between the gallows and thumbscrews. They have to go.

Thane: But they're Dad's.

[Asra puts a hand on Thane's shoulder and speaks softly.]

Asra: Thane, he's not coming back.

Thane: Fuck. I can't... I can't do this...

Asra: Deep breaths, Thane.

[Asra embraces Thane.]

Asra: Shh... I've got you.

[Thane cries silently into her shoulder.]

Asra: We'll get through this. I promise.

[Thane's breathing eventually slows.]

Thane: Thank you.

[The two hold each other in silence.]

Asra: This is my first time being in here. Now I see why the regular basement
is so small. Did Saito do all this himself?

Thane: Most of it. He was the one that bricked it up the basement and made it
two rooms. Mom made the secret entrance for this half.

Asra: That must have been a long time ago. Did Dagan help, too?

Thane: He refused. I guess he didn't agree with them keeping contraband in the 
first place.

Asra: I knew you guys had a collection of banned books, but I never imagined it
would look this cool. I wish I'd come down here earlier. That flag looks like an
antique.

Thane: It's not that much older than we are. Probably just looks like it
because we never see them anymore.

Asra: I can't believe your dad fought against Somoza's regime back before he
rose to power. Your family's so much cooler than mine.

Thane: Didn't do them much good, did it? Mom died in the internment camps, and
now Dad's... I'm sorry. It's not like you haven't lost family yourself.

Asra: I'm still grateful, you know. After the Rega Massacre you were all I had
left. There were a lot of people that had nowhere to go. I'm lucky you were
there to take me in. Thank you.

Thane: Asra, I love you. You know I love you. Did you really think I wouldn't
help you?

Asra: I'm still thankful.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Erawa At a Glance</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra approaches the bookshelf and selects Erawa at a Glance.]

Asra: I've always wanted to know more about Erawa. I mean, aside from what I 
learned in school.

Thane: Asra, you know what we were taught was-

Asra: I know, I know.

[Asra opens the book.]

Asra: "Paranormal phenomena were first observed in Erawa in the sixth century,
though their nature has been closely guarded by the Erawan Empire. Nearly half a 
millennia passed before it was observed that the magnitude and frequency of
these events correlated with their proximity to the center of the peninsula."

Asra: "Legends of Erawan magicians known as 'evincers' have existed for
centuries. However, it wasn't until defected practitioners were interviewed that
scientists theorized the center of Erawa's landmass contained a 'subjective
fracture in objective reality,' which enabled the temporary suspension of
physical law."

Asra: I was always told it was some kind of electric charge that hovered in the
air.

Thane: Yeah. Not even my mom would have described it the way this book does. She
just said the land was sacred.

Asra: "Evincers trained to exploit the Fracture, primarily by manipulating the
natural tundra into a tropical rainforest suitable for agriculture and resource
production, as well as a source of military power during the period of Cheminan
colonization."

Asra: Wait, I've heard of the Fracture. Although I don't really understand how
it works.

Thane: It's sort of like a zone where reality becomes increasingly unstable. But
to be honest, I don't completely understand it myself.

Asra: "The exact nature of the Fracture is unknown - reality becomes
increasingly unstable as one approaches it. Within a forty-mile radius, objects
from an observer's imagination begin to materialize, and objects not being
actively observed may dematerialize. Beyond a thirty mile radius, unconscious
eye movements cause earthquakes, and measurement tools such as rulers begin to
malfunction. Experienced evincers are able to dampen these effects, but there
are no confirmed records of the center having been reached."

Asra: I had no idea the center was so dangerous.

Thane: According to Mom, it's kind of a double-edged sword. It's more dangerous,
but evincers are more powerful there. The whole country is based around how
close people live to the middle. Poor people on the coast, politicians and
clergy farther inland.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Colonialization in Lamenir</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane picks up a book.]

Thane: "Lamenir has a unique ecological history; it is the only landmass with no
natural hunters. As all of its native meat-eaters have instead adapted to living
as scavengers, aggressive behavior is not observed among wildlife or people."

Thane: "It is the lack of aggression in the Lamenir people for which its
subjugation is often attributed. Indeed, it took less than a century for 40% of
its total population to be enslaved by Debonese colonialists."

Thane: "In recent years, mining of raw materials in Lamenir has become a staple
in the global economy, supplying Chemina with coal and iron which are refined
into consumer goods and shipped around the globe."

Asra: Ugh. Are you sure fleeing to Debony is a good idea?

Thane: We're Cheminan. That's different.

Asra: But... Debony sounds just as evil as Chemina. Maybe worse.

Thane: It's not really about good or evil. Chemina wants us on the battlefield. 
Debony wants us for production.

Asra: That sounds like something Dagan would say. "Life is misery. A job is
misery... WITH compensation."

Thane: (Laughs) I don't think he's quite THAT nihilistic. But you're right. He
told me that when Dad was drafted. The part about going to Debony, I mean.

Asra: Wait, he wanted to leave while Saito was on active duty!?

Thane: Well, no. He said we needed a contingency plan in case something happened
to him. I didn't want to talk about it at the time, but here we are.

Asra: Does Dagan care about ANYONE?

Thane: He was really close with my mom, back when she was still around. And he
does cares about me. He's just not good at showing it. And as insensitive as he
can be, he's usually right.

Asra: He can be right all he wants. I just wish he wasn't such an ass about it.

Thane: Yeah, me too.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Erawan Scriptures</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra hands the Erawan Scriptures to Thane.]

Asra: Can you read this?

Thane: The last time anyone could've read it was when Mom was around.

Asra: I thought you knew Erawan.

Thane: My mom taught me a some growing up, but only spoken. I don't know how to
read at all.

Asra: So why keep the scriptures after Phaedra was taken?

Thane: Dad didn't want to let go of anything that reminded him of her. It's
definitely not the safest decision he's made. All of these are banned, but
Erawan literature would be the biggest liability by far.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">A Brief History</button>
<div class="content">

Asra: Have you read all of these?

Thane: Most, but my dad pushed me to read the ones about Chemina's history the
most. A Brief History of Cheminan-Erawan Relations was his favorite.

[Thane picks another book from the shelf.]

Thane: "Due to the Erawan Empire's reliance on a natural landmark which proved
ineffective outside of the local territory, the state adopted isolationist
policies, much to the detriment of foreign relations."

Thane: "Erawan-Cheminan diplomacy only soured in the wake of Chemina's
industrialization, during which engineers proposed using the Fracture to
construct a perpetual energy machine."

Thane: "This sparked outrage among Erawan activists who considered technological
exploitation of the Fracture heresy, escalating political tensions to an all-out
war."

Asra: Wait, what!? I knew this was a resource war, but perpetual motion? That's
crazy!

Thane: Well, you're still a step ahead of everyone that thinks Erawa started the
war.

Asra: I don't know whether to be flattered or depressed.

Thane: "While Chemina has no shortage of allies due to its extensive trade
partnerships around the globe, the probability of foreign intervention in the 
Cheminan-Erawan conflict appears slim."

Thane: "Developed countries have expressed concerns over Chemina's political
instability and the risk of its supreme leader Farid Somoza using the Fracture
to wage a world war, were it ever secured. Consequently, the two nations have
been locked in a stalemate."

Thane: There's a tear on the page. Dad wouldn't read me part of it because he
was afraid I'd talk about it in school. I threw a tantrum and tried to grab it
out of his hand.

Asra: How old were you?

Thane: Five.

Asra: Damn. That's pretty young to be lecturing your kid about politics.

Thane: He said all the children's books were "nationalistic garbage" so he read
these to me instead. Even though he had to paraphrase most of it. Guess he's not
here to protect the book from me this time.

Asra: You shouldn't think of it that way. Those books made you who you are.
They've served their purpose. We're burning them now because we're making room 
or a new life - one where we can be safe from Somoza and this stupid war. If
Saito could see you now he'd be proud.

Thane: What makes you say that? You never even knew him.

Asra: Okay. What would he really think of you?

Thane: I guess... He would have been proud. Probably.

Asra: See? This is the best thing we can do right now.

Thane: ... I'm going to miss him.

Asra: I know.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Book Burning</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane stands at the fireplace. The flag from the basement has been tied into a
bindle holding the books, which Thane holds.]

Thane: Does anyone want to look at these one last time?

Dagan: ...

Thane: (Sigh)

[Thane thrusts the books into the fire and Dagan leaves the room.]

Asra: Guess the censors won.

Thane: Weren't you just saying we had to get rid of these?

Asra: Yeah, but still. Dagan can't be too happy about this, either. Wasn't he
one of the guys trying to get the truth out about the Civil War?

Thane: Well, kind of. He was a war correspondent, but things got... weird.

Asra: What, because he pledged loyalty to Somoza?

Thane: No. Even before Somoza won, Dagan wanted to stay neutral. He mostly
just reported numbers and took photos.

Asra: You said he liked Phaedra, right? Surely he cared that she was taken away?

Thane: By the time Mom was captured, it was clear Somoza was going to win. I
guess Dagan wanted to be on the winning side. Even Dad did, although he kind of
had to for my sake.

Asra: Saito... He lost his wife, pledged his loyalty to the man that had her
killed, and after all that Somoza forced him back onto the battlefield. That's
so fucked up.

Thane: Asra, I really don't want to think about that right now...

Asra: And now all Dagan does is write pro-Somoza propaganda.

Thane: I don't know what to tell you. He's a good writer and it pays the bills.
Neither of us would be here if it weren't for him. But yeah, a lot of those
books were his. You'd think he'd at least care a little about burning them.

Asra: He didn't want to keep contraband in the house in the first place, right?
We all have feelings but we can't let them get in the way of doing what has to
be done.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Police State</button>
<div class="content">

[There's a loud knock at the door.]

Asra: What the-

Thane: Who's there?

Officer: Gheni Police Department. Open up!

[Thane reluctantly opens the door, revealing two officers.]

Officer: We're looking to for a Thane Belikoff.

Thane: Uh...

Officers: You need to come with us.

Thane: Hold on, I'm in-

[One officer raises a gun.]

Officers: If you don't cooperate, we are authorized to use force.

[Two gunshots sound and the officers collapse, dead. Dagan stands behind Thane,
holding a rifle.]

Asra: Holy shit!

Thane: Fuck! Fuck! Dagan, what the fuck?

[Dagan drags both bodies inside and shuts the door.]

Dagan: Quit standing around. We have to move! Take these.

[Dagan hands Asra the rifle, then takes one of the guns from the officers and
gives it to Thane.]

Asra: Dagan, you know I'm a medic, right? I can't shoot.

[Dagan fetches three backpacks and checks their contents while speaking.]

Dagan: Thane can teach you later. For now, just hold onto it.

Thane: You just shot two officers. What-

Dagan: It was either that or let them haul you away to some black site.

Thane: Where did these guns even come from?

Dagan: Your father was a bit of a kleptomaniac. When it was clear Somoza was
winning the war, he started collecting weapons from fallen enemies. Once the war
was over his service weapon was taken but he was able to hide that one.

[Dagan points to the gun he gave to Asra.]

Thane: I had no idea. Wait, shouldn't that have been in the book cellar?

Dagan: (Shrug) Saito hid it in the bedroom. Pretty reckless considering what
would have happened if we'd ever been raided, but I guess keeping it handy
finally paid off.

Asra: Good thing we're already packed.

Thane: What did they even want from me?

Dagan: Who knows? Maybe they double-checked Saito's family records and realized
you were half Erawan. No use worrying about it now. But we really do have to get
out of here.

Thane: Just to be clear, we're headed for Nenegi, right?

Asra: Yeah. That's where Vanna is. She can smuggle us out.

[Dagan rushes to the back door and opens it.]

Dagan: Shit. It's after curfew. Look, in case things go to shit-

Asra: They already have.

Dagan: (Sigh) Think before you shoot. The last thing we need is half the police
department breathing down our necks. If we see someone, we go around. If we
can't, we deal with them silently.

Asra: Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid.

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Defeat in Merad</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane picks up a newspaper and begins to read.]

Thane: "Our valiant soldiers continue their tug of war over Merad. Nineteen
Cheminan casualties were reported on the battlefields this past week. However,
General Jaromir assures us that victory is simply a matter of patience."

Asra: Patience! What is it, three years we've been fighting over that miserable
little town? I'm sure "be patient" is what every mother wants to hear when her
son gets shipped back with half of his limbs blown off.

Dagan: You think reading it's bad? Imagine having to write it.

Thane: Does this kind of stuff really raise morale?

Dagan: Fuck if I know. We don't exactly do A/B testing.

Asra: Do you think they're talking about Saito's unit?

Dagan: Doubt it. Saito was an explosives expert. They wouldn't stick him on the
front lines.

Asra: How did he end up doing that?

Dagan: Past experience. He got plenty of practice blowing stuff up during the
Civil War.

Asra: Wait, Saito was a terrorist!?

Dagan: (Laughs) You could say that.

<div class="content">

[Uniformed figures chase down the trio and throw a canister of tear gas. Thane
sprints behind cover before succumbing to the gas and vomiting.]

Asra: Thane! Are you okay?

Thane: Ugh... Damned tear gas!

Asra: Wait, what-

[Thane continues vomiting.]

Dagan: Asra, grab him. We need to get him somewhere safe.

Thane: No, I'm okay. Let's keep moving.

Asra: Are you sure?

Thane: Yeah... Shit, there's more!

[More troops approach.]

Dagan: I don't-

Thane: Shit!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Trainyard</button>
<div class="content">

[The group sneaks into a trainyard.]

Dagan: We'll need to be really careful here. First sign of trouble and you can
bet they'll search every nook and cranny before another train leaves.

Asra: We also need to figure out which ones are headed to Nenegi.

[The group sneaks between cars for a bit, eventually finding a tank car.]

Thane: Nenegi's a military town. Any tanker car carrying nitro or poison gas
would be headed there.

Dagan: Most are probably just petrol, in which case they could be going
anywhere.

Thane: The valves up top should have different warnings depending on the
contents. We can climb up and check.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Narrow Escape</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra is on top of one of the tanker cars, with Thane and Dagan waiting below.]

Watchman: You there! Hands where I can see them!

[A guard approaches, gun aimed at Asra. Thane and Dagan retreat into the
shadows. Asra slowly turns toward the watchman and raises her hands.]

Watchman: Bit past your bedtime, isn't it, miss? Get down from there. Now.

[Asra slowly climbs down and turns to face the watchman.]

Watchman: What were you doing up there?

Asra: ...

Watchman: Not a talker, eh?

[The watchman slams the butt of his rifle into Asra's gut, causing her to fall
to the ground. Thane raises his gun, but Dagan stops him and shakes his head.]

Watchman: Still don't feel like talking?

[The watchman brings his boot down between Asra's legs and digs his heel into
her.]

Thane: Bastard!

[Thane shoves Dagan off of him and shoots the watchman in the head, then rushes
over to Asra.]

Dagan: Thane, you idiot!

Thane: Are you alright?

Asra: ... Yeah. Let's hide.

[Thane helps Asra to her feet, only for the train to begin moving almost
immediately.]

Dagan: What the-

Asra: Get on! That tanker's carrying nitro.

[The group grabs onto a ladder and climb up onto a car carrying lumber. Asra
slips beneath a tarp covering the car.]

Asra: Peekaboo!

Thane: (She sure is resilient.)

[Thane and Dagan follow suit and join her inside the train car.]

Dagan: Mind telling me why you led us into this death trap? There's no way the
conductor heard a gunshot and decided to just ignore it.

Asra: I think that's exactly what happened. Sure beats having to spend several
hours giving the police a statement and then explaining to his boss why a
shipment is late.

Dagan: If that is what happened, we're damn lucky the conductor was already in
the pilot. Thane, what the fuck were you thinking?

Thane: Are you being serious right now? What was I supposed to do, just sit by
and watch?

Dagan: He had his back to you. You could have held him at gunpoint without
firing. You could have used your knife. Shooting him was beyond reckless.

Asra: Nine times out of ten, something like that would have gotten us killed.

Thane: I don't believe what I'm hearing. This is the thanks I get for saving
you?

Asra: No, that's not... (Sigh) You did save me, and I'm grateful for that.
Really, I mean it. But there are better ways you could have handled that.

[Beat]

Thane: I know it was impulsive. I just couldn't... I really want to keep you
safe. Even if I'm bad at it. Sorry.

Asra: You're not bad at it. You probably saved my life a dozen times over
tonight. But what happened just now was a big lapse of judgment. Please don't do
it again.

[Thane nods. There's a pause, then Asra shivers.]

Thane: You cold?

Asra: Yeah.

[Thane wraps his arms around Asra, and she leans back into him.]

## CHAPTER 3: CHALT ##
######################

<button class="collapsible">Cargo Inspection</button>
<div class="content">

[The train slows and comes to a halt.]

Thane: Is this Chalt?

Dagan: Mhm. The Capital Spire is right there, see?

Asra: You know the city?

Dagan: I spent a lot of time here during the war. Chalt was a big tipping point.
Conquering it was a huge feat, and one of the biggest reasons Somoza saw fit to
make it the new capital. Hence the spire.

Asra: Either that or he's compensating for something.

Thane: Oh, come on. That's just a Debonese stereotype.

Asra: Wait, what? Somoza's Cheminan.

Dagan: Somoza's Debonese-Cheminan by blood. He grew up in Nenegi, but he had a
lot of connections back in Debony.

Asra: How did he become so powerful? His whole platform is based on Cheminan
nationalism.

Thane: Don't forget industrialization. He invested in factories and started
making guns.

Dagan: You're leaving out a big part of what actually happened. In order to make
those investments, Somoza needed money and support. Most of that came from
Debony's public sector. Unofficially, of course.

Asra: No way. Did they know they were funding a civil war?

Dagan: Oh yes, and it's exactly what they wanted to happen, too. And it wasn't
just weapons. People that hung around Somoza started getting all kinds of nice
bonuses. That's how he got all the manpower behind his campaign.

Asra: If Debony is backing Somoza, why do we want to escape there?

Dagan: They used to support him. Back before the war, Debony was anxious to get
its hands on our technology.

Asra: They still are.

Dagan: Right. Ever since we discovered electricity, they've been pushing
nonstop for a way to start manufacturing their own goods. Somoza was supposed to
seize control of Chemina, then send all the research and prototypes back home.

Asra: But he was having too much fun playing dictator to let Chemina turn into a
puppet state, is that it?

Thane: So why didn't Debony just go to war with us?

Dagan: Hard to say. For one, it would be a complete bloodbath. They have a
large enough military to overpower us, but our artillery would make it a very
costly fight. The other reason is it's still in their interest to trade with us.

Asra: What do you mean they could overpower us? Isn't the Cheminan army the
strongest in Kabel?

Dagan: (Laughs) Who told you that?

[Asra makes a sour face just before it's illuminated by a bright light. She
shrinks back into the shadows.]

Thane: What was that?

Dagan: Cargo inspection. Time to go.

Asra: Where? Curfew's still in effect.

Dagan: We'll have to figure that out later. If they're investigating after our
little incident in Gheni, we need to find another way to Nenegi.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Night Patrol Killed</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane unfolds a newspaper and begins to read]

Thane: "Early this morning, officers reported one casualty in Gheni Transit
Center. Forensics confirmed the cause of death to be a gunshot wounds, some from
Civil War-era weapons."

Dagan: Let me guess. A reward-

Thane: "A reward of up to 1,000 lauves shall be offered to anyone providing
evidence leading to the capture of the suspects Thane Belikoff, Dagan Belikoff,
and Asra Sacco. All three are considered to be armed and dangerous."

Dagan: Perfect, they already know who we are.

Asra: He was hardly the only guy we killed. Why not give the full report?
Wouldn't they want to make us look less sympathetic?

Dagan: You think they'd admit they weren't able to contain the situation? It's
better if it looks like a random act of violence. We're still the bad guys
either way.

[Asra looks down.]

Asra: Thane... I'm a murderer now.

Thane: There was no other way. It's not like you enjoyed it.

Asra: ... I did.

[Beat]

Asra: I tried to tell myself they were people. With their own lives, their own
families. But right before I pulled the trigger... It was gone. All I cared
about was hitting them. Like it was some kind of game.

Dagan: So much the better. Hesitation is death.

Asra: Stay out of this!

[Thane and Asra make eye contact.]

Thane: I don't know what to tell you. It bothers me, too. But we have to keep
going.

Asra: I know. It's just... (Sigh) What's it like for you? Do you find it
exciting too?

Thane: Physically, kind of. Mostly it's just stressful.

Asra: I never wanted to be in the medical unit, but at least I never felt bad
about what I did. This... this is awful, and somehow it feels natural at the
same time. I don't want to get used to it, but it's already happening.

Thane: It won't be like this forever. Vanna will smuggle us out and we won't
have to do this ever again.

Asra: And then what? I can't just forget about this and move on like it never
happened.

Thane: Don't try to figure everything out right now. I can't promise everything
will be perfect, but I know you'll come to peace with this. Give it time.

Asra: (Sigh) Okay.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Streetwalker</button>
<div class="content">

[The group walks through the streets of Chalt, Dagan in front.]

Thane: Hey Dagan, those pants have a rip at the crotch.

Dagan: Nothing I can do about it. All the uniforms we've stolen are too small.

Thane: How have we still not found anything that's a good fit?

Dagan: We're not trying to. You want to hunt down someone the same size as me?
We'd be better off going to a black market.

Asra: It might be worth it. But I don't think any of us have connections in
Chalt.

[Beat]

Dagan: Stay here.

[Dagan approaches an escort on the corner.]

Dagan: Hey.

Thane: ... What is he doing?

Escort: Hey there. Anything I can help you with?

Dagan: Yeah. I'm looking for some supplies.

Escort: Sure thing, hun. I know someone that can help you.

Asra: Why does he think SHE can help us?

Thane: (Shrugs) No idea.

[The escort begins walking away. Dagan follows, Thane and Asra catching up.]

Dagan: I thought I told you guys to wait. Chalt is dangerous.

Escort: Whoa, what the fuck is this?

Dagan: Keep walking. We're not looking for trouble.

[The escort pauses, then continues walking nervously.]

Asra: She's just going to trust us that easily?

Thane: I don't think she trusts us. I think Dagan has a gun.

Asra: Okay, but... Why her?

Dagan: Chalt was practically torn to shreds during the Civil War. I spent a lot
of time snapping photos in this area and got to know a lot of locals. Including
the mob.

Thane: Meaning?

Dagan: Gangs in Chalt are well-connected, and there's a strong network for
organized crime. Escorts were always a good entry point for things like drugs
and weapons because they had the most visibility.

Asra: Isn't the job of any prostitute to be a good entry point?

Thane: Nice.

Asra: If you know the city so well, why don't we just find someone you already
know? Wouldn't that be safer?

Dagan: I didn't stay in contact with anyone after the war, and even if I did,
Somoza killed every dissident he could find. Even their kids.

Asra: He killed children just because their parents opposed him!?

Dagan: It's a good strategy. If you're in it for the long haul, the most
important rules are to control what your youth sees and kill the youth of your
enemies.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Meeting Malik</button>
<div class="content">

[The escort leads them into an apartment complex. She knocks on a door.]

Merchant: Yeah?

Fayth: Hey Malik, it's Fayth. I've got some people looking for gear.

[The door opens as much as the door chain allows, with a man behind it.]

Malik: Never seen these guys before. What brings you here?

Thane: We need a police uniform. For him.

[Thane gestures to Dagan. Malik looks him over.]

Malik: Not sure I've got anything big enough, but I'll dig around What do you
need 'em for, anyway?

Asra: Just playing dress-up.

Malik: Bit old for that, aren't we?

Asra: It's a fetish.

Dagan: Hey-

Malik: Whatever. Not my business. Give me a second.

[Malik closes the door.]

Asra: Is it always hard for you to find clothes?

Dagan: Not always, but it's pretty common. Sure wish it were easier to find
things in my size.

Asra: To be fair, you are pretty big.

Dagan: Not really. It's more that you kids all grew up malnourished. By the time
we got refrigerators and electric cookers there was hardly any food to put in
them.

[The door opens again. Behind it, Malik is holding a uniform.]

Malik: This is the largest size I have. Twenty lauves, if you don't mind.

Asra: That's absurd! Fayth, how many blowjobs could I get for that?

Fayth: You specifically? Maybe you should take a health class or something,
because-

Malik: You want 'em or not?

Dagan: We don't even know if they fit yet.

Malik: Try it on.

[Thane and Asra look away as Dagan changes into the uniform.]

Dagan: Better than the last one.

[Dagan hands over the money.]

Malik: Anything else?

Dagan: Yeah, got any painkillers?

Malik: Closest thing I've got is Ribatol.

[Dagan turns to Thane.]

Dagan: Ribatol? Isn't that the name of the drug they gave you in the evincer
program?

Thane: Yeah. It's a hallucinogen, but you can use it for pain relief as a last
resort.

Asra: Wait, what? Thane...

Thane: What? Quit looking at me like that.

Asra: Sorry. It's just... hallucinogens are scary.

Thane: Why? Did you have a bad experience or something?

Asra: Not me, but yes. A few years back, one of my friends started experimenting
with mushrooms. Something happened. He started having relapses, even after he'd
stopped taking them. The doctor diagnosed him with something. Can't remember
what he called it.

Dagan: That sounds like HPPD - hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. I
don't know much about it except that it usually only happens if you're a really
heavy user.

Thane: Guess I got lucky. They gave us a lot of that stuff, but I never noticed
anything unusual after the initial effects wore off.

Asra: Fuck. I can't believe they would take a risk like that. Why would they
want to drug you to begin with?

Thane: Evincing is all about changing your perception to make it reality.
Ribatol is supposed to facilitate that. The goal was to induce hallucinations
that the user could control, and that was supposed to manifest them in reality.

Asra: Did it work?

Thane: Honestly, no. Although it was hard to tell. Some people seemed to get
better at evincing when using it, just not me.

Asra: I guess I see the logic. Still, it's fucked up that they're using
Cheminan civilians to test stuff like that.

Dagan: They probably tested it on prisoners of war first.

Asra: Oh. Well in that case it's fine.

Malik: You guys made up your mind yet?

[A shop opens.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Squatting</button>
<div class="content">

[The group stands at Malik's door, at the landing of a stairwell.]

Thane: We should find a place to settle down for the night. We can't keep going
around past curfew. We'll get ourselves killed.

Dagan: We could just sleep here.

Thane: I don't even know where this is.

Dagan: We're in the old uptown area. It's not a great neighborhood, and my guess
is it only got worse after the war ended. We should stay put until morning.

Asra: This place seems as good a place as any. Let's try the stairwell. If it
opens to the roof we can probably sleep on the landing without any trouble.

[The three climb just past the top floor.]

Thane: There's a slight breeze here, but it's not bad. Doubt anyone'll come up
here in the middle of the night.

[Thane lays a blanket out. They huddle together on the landing. Dagan lays down
and closes his eyes.]

Thane: You were great today. I know it's a lot to deal with, but you're handling
it really well.

Asra: Thank you. I... How do you and Dagan do it? How does it not affect you?

Thane: It does affect us. At least, it affects me. If I'm being honest, this is
way worse than the army. Back then I had a captain, a base, some semblance of a
plan...

Asra: Feels like forever ago, doesn't it? I still remember the first time we
met. Well, I'm not sure if it counts, since you were unconscious on the
stretcher. Just talking about it makes it sound like the opening to some bad
soap opera.

Thane: And the first thing I saw when I came to were those stormy gray eyes. And
then you nursed me back to health and we lived-

Asra: Oh, shut up.

Thane: You're the one that brought up soap operas.

Asra: You call this happily ever after? Man, I'd hate to see what your idea of a
downer ending is.

Thane: It's not much of an ending at all. We still have to make it to Debony
first. But it could be a worse.

Asra: Could be a lot better, too. What if we'd left before those officers tried
to drag you away? We'd already be in Nenegi by now and no one would be after us.

Thane: They'd still be after me. You and Dagan would be in the clear though.

Asra: Ah, right...

Thane: But seriously, think about how shitty it would be to do this alone. Not
to mention borderline suicidal. Having you here makes a world of difference.

[Asra cuddles up to Thane and closes her eyes.]

Asra: Yeah. I couldn't have done this without you, either.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Leaving Chalt</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio wakes up on the stairwell, sharing a can of food.]

Thane: So, what's the plan for today?

Dagan: That's a damn good question. After the debacle at the trainyard there's
no way we can go back and hitch a ride to Nenegi. Our best bet might be going by
horseback.

Asra: What about a car?

Dagan: How would that work? None of us can drive. Besides, even renting one
would be outside of our price range.

Thane: Horseback should work just fine. Let's head downtown and see what we can
find.

Dagan: I haven't been here in quite some time, but there used to be tons of
stables in old town. We're probably better off looking there first.

Thane: Alright, we can start there. You think anyone in Chalt is going to be
looking for us yet?

Asra: Hard to say. They might still think we're in Gheni.

Dagan: I wouldn't worry too much about it. Even if they know we're here, there's
more than enough crime in Chalt to keep the cops busy.

Asra: Wouldn't Somoza want the capital to be... I don't know, nicer?

Dagan: It's plenty nice by all the government buildings and tourist attractions.
Only the residential districts look like a dump. Which I'm sure suits him just
fine.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Remembrance of the Rega Massacre
</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane opens a newspaper and begins to read]

Thane: "Today marks the one year anniversary of the Rega Massacre, a tragic
event in which 413 civilians and 588 soldiers were killed in an unprovoked
assault on Cheminan territory."

Asra: Hard to believe it's been a year already.

Thane: "General Jaromir reminds our brave soldiers that the enemy is ruthless
and underhanded, and that it is tragedies such as these that demand our troops
remain steadfast in protecting our great nation."

Dagan: Ugh, Jaromir... The sooner that leech dies, the better.

Asra: ... What?

Dagan: You heard me.

Asra: Jaromir's one of the best tacticians we have. Do you know how many of our
soldiers would be dead if it weren't for him?

Dagan: Does it matter? It's one thing to be a strategist. It's another to play
the part of some media rockstar and propagandize the war. I don't understand why
you're getting behind a patriotic narrative like this.

Asra: It's not about patriotism! My parents died that day! I hate war as much as
the next guy, but it's not like we could just call for a ceasefire tomorrow and
Erawa would stop attacking us.

Dagan: I'm not talking about the damned massacre, I'm talking about the article!
Jaromir isn't from Rega; he's from Chalt. He doesn't give a shit about your
parents, he's just using the massacre as an excuse to draw support.

Asra: It IS the anniversary of the massacre. What are they supposed to do, just
pretend it never happened?

Dagan: No. I'm saying it's wrong to stand on the bodies of your parents to
rattle off war propaganda.

Asra: That's pretty rich coming from you. You write shit like this all the time!

Dagan: It's not as though I enjoy writing that garbage. You know as well as I do
that you have to toe the party line to make it in this country. I did what I had
to do to support Thane. And you, in case you forgot.

Asra: So if Jaromir's pro-military it's despicable, but if you are it's just
self-preservation. Is that right?

Thane: Are you two done?

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Trolley</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio approach a stop where passengers are boarding a trolley.]

Soldier: Because our great leader is holding a rally at the square, the only
routes in service today are those running to or from the downtown area!

Dagan: Just what we needed.

Asra: Doesn't cost us more than a bit of time. We can still get horses
afterward.

Thane: At least it's only a rally. Better than a public execution.

Dagan: Hardly.

[The trio board.]

Asra: I'm sure a captive audience does wonders for Somoza's self-esteem.

Thane: Keep your voice down! Are you trying to get us killed?

[The trio boards a trolley and heads toward the square.]

Asra: There might be stables downtown, too. It's worth looking around while
we're there. Might save us some time.

Dagan: Downtown Chalt is the most modernized neighborhood in the country, maybe
the most modern on Kabel. My guess is almost everyone there uses automobiles.
But you're right. It's still worth looking.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Rally</button>
<div class="content">

[Somoza stands at a podium, delivering a speech.]

Farid Somoza: "On this day, one year ago, Cleric Gael Mancini saw fit to send an
army to our homeland, slaughtering hundreds of innocents. This is a travesty of
justice that our people must never forget. But neither shall we forget the
bravery shown by those who laid down their lives that day protecting their
neighbors.

"I consider tragedies such as these to show the inherent difference between us.
In Erawa, I see barbaric acts taken against non-combatants. I see the cowardice
of an enemy that cannot fight with honor. But in our people, I see courage -
the courage to stand against such an enemy, to defend our homeland, and most
importantly, to rebuild and prosper anew amidst the threat we face.

"When I first came to lead Chemina, I was faced with a great deal of opposition.
I saw the looming threat of Erawa, but soft-hearted apologists assured me that
such concerns were unnecessary. Many were blind to the enemy which threatened
to destroy us from within. It is chilling to imagine the scope of destruction we
undoubtedly would have faced had such naivety been the prevailing mentality when
Erawa first invaded. Our children may well be speaking Erawan in school, or
forced to adopt their occult practices.

"Remember that Erawa is the antithesis of all that we stand for. They are a
people dependent upon their archaic witchcraft. Their society is one of
stagnation, and for all their history, they have nothing to show for the time
they have had to civilize themselves.

"But, compare their society to ours! Progress and cooperation are Chemina's
foundation, and while the fight ahead of us may be long and arduous, I encourage
you also to look at how far we have come. Why, just within my lifetime, I have
seen the genesis of motor vehicles and aircraft, the proliferation of electrical
power in the form of various appliances, and a country that has become ever more
interconnected thanks to railroads and the telegraph.

"For this reason I have certainty that our triumph over Erawa is inevitable. As
our country marches onward and our technology becomes ever more advanced, they
sit and twiddle their thumbs. Erawa is much the same as it has always been, and
is doomed to remain as such.

"It is also for this reason that I know we are righteous in this conflict. For
not only have we transformed ourselves, the entirety of Kabel has been
transformed by the fruits of our innovation! We toil not just to benefit
ourselves, but to the benefit of all humanity. Standing before me I do not see
engineers and soldiers, but pioneers of a new age and guardians of our destiny.
Chemina leads the future!"

Thane: Oh, shit.

Asra: What is it?

Thane: On my left. I know that guy. We were squadmates. I have to get out of
here before he recognizes me.

Asra: Do you think he knows the authorities are looking for you?

Dagan: Doesn't matter. We shouldn't risk hanging around here. There's a bar on
the top floor of Knox Tower. We'll be out of sight, plus we can look around to
see if there are any stables downtown while we're up there.

[The trio slink off toward the tower.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Iron Sights</button>
<div class="content">

[The group enter Knox Tower]

Receptionist: Are you here for Knox Bar and Grill? You can take the elevator to
the top floor.

Dagan: We'll take the stairs, thanks.

Receptionist: If you insist.

[The trio enters the stairwell of the Knox Tower and begin climbing.]

Thane: What's that all about?

Dagan: I don't like elevators.

Thane: We're lucky no one questions us in uniform.

Dagan: Luck has nothing to do with it. It's not like we're wearing these on
accident.

Asra: Not to mention we all look fiendishly attractive.

Thane: Wait. This building has sixty floors. Are we really taking the stairs
this whole way?

Dagan: Thane already recognized one person here. No reason to risk bumping into
another familiar face.

[Beat]

Asra: Do you think Somoza's right about us moving into a new age?

Dagan: I think change is coming. But I also think Somoza's biting off more than
he can chew. If he keeps trying to trade technology like gold and spices it's
going to blow up in his face.

Thane: Why? He's been supreme leader my whole life and I've never seen anything
so much as threaten his rule.

Dagan: It's not about politics, it's about the technology itself. It's taken all
of 40 years to go from steam engines to biplanes. It's great for him in the
short-term, but eventually the market is going to overthrow him.

Asra: How? Somoza controls the market, too.

Dagan: Only in Chemina. He's not in a position to cope with the changes
technology is creating.

Asra: Are you saying we'll have to compete with another country? You said
yourself Chemina has the most advanced engineers in Kabel.

Dagan: We're already competing with the United Territories. It might be in the
early stages, but our technology is being reverse engineered, and as long as we
keep trading with them, they'll keep catching up. Give it a few years and I
guarantee Somoza's going to start losing his footing.

Thane: You say that like we're just handing over everything we've got. Debony's
still using muskets and we've got machine guns.

Dagan: I'm sure Somoza is thinking the same thing, but that's exactly why his
rule isn't going to last. He's too stubborn, and despite all the resources he's
put into R&D, he treats everything like it's a military operation. Economics and
diplomacy are delicate. Somoza doesn't do delicate.

Asra: So you're saying Debony's just going to leave us in the dust? Even if that
were true, how would that affect Somoza?

Dagan: Think. Not only is the United Territories bigger than us, they're our
biggest trade partner. Once they have what they need they'll stop buying from
us, and they'll probably be able to export goods to other countries cheaper than
we can. Chemina will crumble from the inside out.

Asra: You say that like it's certain, but there are tons of countries that do
just fine without being economic superpowers.

Thane: Dagan's got a point, though. Once Debony stops trading with us, how's
Somoza going to fund the war effort? If we're still at war with Erawa by the
time that happens, they'll completely mow us over.

Dagan: That's surprisingly astute. And optimistic, now that I think about it.

[Thane approaches a window, then waves them over.]

Thane: Hey, come look at this.

[Somoza, still speaking, is visible through the window.]

Dagan: Whoa...

Asra: Holy shit. We could totally hit him from here.

Thane: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. What are the odds?

Asra: One in a million? This doesn't even make sense.

Dagan: I can hardly believe what I'm seeing. This looks too good to be true. Do
we really want to though?

Asra: How could you not? We'd be insane to pass up something like this.

Dagan: Thane, listen to me closely. If you shoot him, all of us will die. I'm
not saying it's wrong, but you need to understand that.

<div class="content">

[Asra and Thane watch Somoza's speech from afar]

Asra: He started the war that killed my parents. He sent both of yours away to
die. He shouldn't be alive. Not after everything he's done.

Thane: You realize there's no way we could get away with this, right?

Asra: This is going to sound impulsive, but I don't care. We're just three
people, Thane. What are our lives worth compared to the millions that are
suffering because of him? This is bigger than just us.

Thane: Now you're starting to sound like the revolutionary. I didn't think you
would be so eager to do this.

Asra: My family might have been misinformed but we weren't naive. I was taught
in school to love Somoza, but we were also afraid. There's only so much you can
fear someone before you start to resent them. I want him dead.

Thane: So do I, but I also want to make it out of this country alive. I want to
have a future with you. Isn't that what you wanted, too?

Asra: What if someone else had the same chance to kill him, but didn't? What if
they said the same thing you did? I want to escape with you, Thane. So, so
badly. But we can't take an opportunity like this and do nothing with it.

Thane: Weren't you just saying you were afraid of how bloodthirsty you were
becoming? Are you sure this is what you want?

Asra: This is different. I'm not the one holding the gun. And I've wanted Somoza
dead long before we decided we wanted to go to Debony.

Thane: But... Would you really rather have your vengeance than make it over the
border? Aren't you more important than that? Aren't I?

Asra: I don't want to bully you into getting yourself killed based on my whim.
If I were a good enough shot I'd shoot him myself and take full responsibility,
but I'm not. And it's not right for me to make the decision for all of us.

Thane: You didn't answer my question. Does killing him mean that much to you?

Asra: I... don't know. I do love you. But what if we don't shoot him and we
still get caught trying to flee? What if we pass up this chance and it's all for
nothing?

Thane: What if I shoot and miss? There's always a chance something could go
wrong.

Asra: From here? You won't miss.

Thane: ... Yeah, you're right. I won't.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Dagan: Assassination</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan watch Somoza's speech from afar]

Dagan: I'd think twice before pulling that trigger. You know his son is just
going to take over, right? Besides, his regime is doomed to fall even without
our help.

Thane: Yeah, but-

Dagan: But what? What's done is done. You can't bring back the people that are
already dead, and killing Somoza now isn't going to help anyone either. Changing
the world is more complicated than shooting bad guys.

Thane: He still deserves to die.

Dagan: Sure he does. But are you going to throw all of our lives away based on
who deserves what?

Thane: Are you telling me not to shoot him?

Dagan: ... No. I don't ever want to tell someone the story about how my nephew
almost killed Farid Somoza until I talked him out of it. I could never live with
myself.

Thane: What do you want, then?

Dagan: I'm staying neutral.

Thane: You haven't changed at all since the Civil War, have you? Can't pick a
side, even when the whole country is at stake. 

Dagan: The country isn't at stake. Your choice here ultimately changes nothing.

Thane: And I'm somehow supposed to believe you're NOT trying to convince me to
walk away? Is this your idea of integrity?

Dagan: My integrity went out the window the day your mother was taken away.

Thane: ...

Dagan: Pledging loyalty to Somoza... I did that out of self-preservation. This
is different. I'm letting you make this choice yourself, even if it kills me.

Thane: You're putting your life in my hands that easily? Is this important to
you or not?

Dagan: This is extremely important to me, but both choices have merit. That's
why I'm not trying to sway you either way. Just so long as you understand the
consequences.

<button class="collapsible">Shooting Somoza</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane shoots Somoza. Below, the crowd erupts into chaos.]

Dagan: Well, it was nice knowing you guys.

[Above, a door is flung open and footsteps are heard descending the stairs.]

Asra: Move!

Thane: (Not much point in running, but it's better than standing around until
we get arrested or shot.)

[The trio flees the tower to the street. Above, a blimp floats into view.]

Dagan: Shit.

Asra: If this is where I die, I'm not going down without a fight. Come on,
Thane!

Dagan: Just run! Guns won't do anything against that airship!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Sparing Somoza</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane lowers his gun.]

Thane: Sorry, Asra. I love you too much. I can't put you in danger. Not when
we've come so far. Besides, Dagan is right. Literally nothing would change about
Chemina if I shot him now.

Asra: That... wasn't my preference.

Thane: I don't want to be some kind of hero or revolutionary. I just want to
live. You can call me selfish if you want. I don't care. Come on, I think I saw
stables on the other end of the plaza.

Asra: ...

Thane: You still want to escape with me, right? This is how we're going to make
that happen.

[The trio make their way back to the street and make their way to the stables.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Spare: Meltdown</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio approach the stables.]

Dagan: Hey. We're looking to rent three horses for the day.

Thane: Make it two. I don't know how to ride.

Dagan: You sure this is gonna work?

Asra: It shouldn't be a problem. Thane and I can ride double.

Stablehand: Two, then?

Dagan: Yeah, two's fine.

Stablehand: You said just for the day, right? That's five lauves, and I'll be
holding onto an additional 25 as collateral.

Thane: Ouch.

Dagan: I'll have a look at the horses, if you don't mind.

Stablehand: Of course.

[Dagan examines the horses for a moment, then reaches into his pocket, hands
over the money, and signs with a fake name.]

Asra: I didn't know you carried that kind of cash around.

Dagan: Saito and I put aside savings in case we ever had to fund a little
adventure like this. Most people aren't so lucky.

Asra: Hold on. You say Thane is malnourished, but you've been stashing away
money this whole time?

Dagan: Asra, please. Saving for long-term contingencies isn't mutually exclusive
with taking care of day-to-day expenses. What kind of person do you think I am?

[Dagan mounts his horse, then Asra, and Thane behind her.]

Stablehand: I'll need these back by sundown tomorrow.

Dagan: Acknowledged.

[The trio begin riding down the street.]

Asra: Poor bastard.

Thane: Can't be helped. At least he'll get to keep the money.

Asra: These horses are probably worth double what he took as collateral. But
you're right. There's no way he's getting them back.

Thane: Shit, there he is again.

[Thane presses himself against Asra and looks the other way.]

Asra: The guy that knows you?

Thane: Yeah. His name is Ludo.

Asra: He's coming toward us. Keep facing the other way.

Ludo: Get down!! Those are the criminals from Gheni!

[Ludo draws his weapon and aims it in the direction of the trio. A few soldiers
draw their own guns, while civilians scatter.]

Dagan: Run!

[Thane pulls out a pistol and fires toward Ludo. He misses, but Ludo dives for
cover. Asra and Dagan pick up speed. Shots ring behind them.]

Asra: Damn it, Thane! I knew it! I fucking knew it! We should have shot him when
we had the chance!

Thane: Save it for later. We need to get out of here!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Armored Car</button>
<div class="content">

[An armored car with a mounted turret rolls onto the street and fires at them.
The horses are hit, sending the trio sprawling onto the street. They scatter
for cover.]

Thane: Fuck. This... There's no way. This is impossible.

Asra: Come on, Thane! Smoke the turret and flank the gunner. We can do this! I
won't let you die here, so quit moping and fucking move!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Shoot: Blimp Down</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio get into the armored car, still being shot at by the blimp.]

Asra: Thane, the turret!

Thane: What?

Asra: It's using incendiary rounds! Use it on the blimp!

[Thane climbs on top of the car and fires at the blimp, which erupts in flames
instantly.]

Thane: What the-?

Asra: Yeah!! Eat that, bitch!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Roadtrip</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra starts driving away, bullets glancing off the rear of the vehicle.]

Thane: I thought you couldn't drive?

Asra: Shh, don't jinx it.

Dagan: I have no idea how we did that.

Asra: Yeah, that was... something else. How are you holding up, Thane?

Thane: I... Thank you.

Asra: Huh? For what?

Thane: For making me get my shit together. I really thought we were going to die
back there. Thank you.

Asra: What was I supposed to do, tell you to lie down and die? I might have
wanted Somoza dead, I still do want to escape with you. I love you and I'm not
letting anyone take you away from me.

Thane: Escape...? We're not just a couple criminals running from city to city.
They're going to see us as domestic terrorists. It doesn't matter where we
drive, we'll be shot on sight.

Asra: We ditch the Vollmer when we reach Nenegi and hope that no one there has
seen our faces on a wanted poster yet.

Thane: What's the point? Escaping at this point is impossible.

Dagan: We lose nothing by trying.

Asra: Dagan's right. Come on, Thane. Where's all this coming from?

Thane: What do you think!? Did you see what happened back there? Like, can we
talk about what that means for a second?

Dagan: Fine. The whole country is after us now. We're probably going to die. Is
that what you wanted to hear?

[Asra takes Thane's hand in hers and squeezes, her other hand still on the
wheel.]

Asra: Thane. I want to get out of this country, but I can't do it on my own. I
need you. So please, don't give up. I don't want to die here.

Thane: (Quietly) Okay.

## CHAPTER 4: NENEGI ##
#######################

<button class="collapsible">Waylaid</button>
<div class="content">

[Dagan, Asra, and Thane ride past trees and smokestacks in the Vollmer Armored
Car.]

Thane: I always wanted to see your hometown. Never imagined it would be like
this.

Asra: Really? I always dreamed of taking you back with me in a three-ton
Vollmer.

Thane: You know what I mean. I wish I'd gotten to know your parents.

Asra: Stop romanticizing it like that, Thane. I already told you they were
small-minded. If they'd known I was seeing some half-Erawan guy...

Dagan: Sounds like it's for the best you never had to meet them.

Asra: Are you saying it's good that they died!?

Dagan: So what if I am? The world needs less racists.

Asra: No one is all bad, you know. My parents were racist, but they were good
people. When my grandfather got dementia, they took care of him for three years,
even when he started attacking them. You're telling me they still deserved to
die?

Dagan: It's not a matter of who deserved what. Innocent people always suffer.
More suffer if you let destructive beliefs fester. Even if they're festering in
good people.

Asra: So those people should die just because you don't agree with them? How can
you be so confident your opinions are the right ones?

Dagan: Because I am. I'm not going to change my view just because other people
disagree with me.

Asra: So what are you saying, you should just kill anyone with the wrong
opinions? You think a bunch of people fighting over their beliefs is the only
way? That's no different from the dark ages!

Dagan: Have you ever stopped to consider there's a reason history's just one war
after another? Do you think you've personally figured out something that the
rest of humanity is just too dumb to grasp?

Asra: Why do you refuse to see the other side? Do you believe in compromise at
all!?

Dagan: The last time I didn't pick a side, Thane's mother died. I will never
subscribe to that bullshit faux-centrism again.

Asra: You don't think I miss my parents, too?

[Beat]

Thane: ... Can we please talk about something else?

[Beat]

Asra: Do you think you'll be able to do any evincing in Nenegi?

Thane: That's a really good question. Nenegi is pretty close to the Erawan
border. I might be able to do something simple. Control a coin flip, maybe.

Asra: Is that what you learned to do before?

Thane: It was one of the things. Just about everything I learned was really easy
stuff, and probably not that useful.

Asra: Who taught you? Was it your mom, or the guys in the evincer program?

Thane: Mom never talked much about evincing. Gheni was way too far from the
Fracture for her to do stuff, so she couldn't have taught me if she'd wanted to.
She did talk about the spiritual aspect, though.

Asra: So the training was different?

Thane: Definitely. It was secular, of course. There were only twenty of us, and
the whole thing was supposed to be under wraps. Mostly they just gave us the
enhancements and started us off by showing us optical illusions.

Asra: Why would that do anything?

Thane: Evincing is more than just willing things to happen. You have to believe
they're already happening. So for instance, if you see a pencil in a glass of
water and it looks broken because of refraction, you can snap it in half for
real.

Asra: That's crazy!

Thane: Yeah. We also rigged dice a lot.

Asra: Why dice? That sounds weirdly specific and kind of pointless.

Thane: Evincing is kind of like a glorified placebo effect. Stuff that's based
on luck is easy because you can imagine it happening, even if it's unlikely. The
point is to skew the odds in your favor.

Asra: But this was still a military program, right? Did you ever use that spar
with each other?

Thane: Eventually, yeah. Fighting is way harder because you can use your own
perception to suppress the other person's abilities. Most of the time you just
cancel each other out. I was never great at it. That, and there was the whole
medical discharge thing, so I never finished the program.

Asra: Yeah, what was that about? You've never explained why that happened.

Thane: That's because I don't understand it myself. They kept saying I was sick,
but I felt totally fine. They wouldn't even wait for me to recover.

Asra: That's really bizarre. I've never heard of something like that happening.
Half the time they don't care how battered or bruised you are. As far as they're
concerned, you're meat.

Thane: One more thing to look forward to in Debony, I suppose.

Dagan: I wouldn't be so sure about that.

Asra: What do you mean?

Dagan: You didn't think Debony would take you in out of the good of their
hearts, did you? Both of you are engineers. I guarantee they're gonna milk every
trade secret out of you and then some.

Asra: You make it sound like it's not worth trying to escape at all.

Dagan: I never said that. Debony won't force you to fight, they won't care that
Thane's half-Erawan, and you'll be compensated far better than you are here.
That's gotta count for something, right?

[Asra points into the distance.]

Asra: We're coming up on Nenegi. If we get too close in the Vollmer, someone's
bound to see us. We should ditch this thing and keep going on foot.

Thane: (And to think I almost forgot how fucked we are.)

Dagan: No doubt there's a patrol waiting to cut us off when we get there. They
saw us headed for Nenegi when we made it outside city limits.

Asra: Nenegi is surrounded by rocky terrain. It's one of the reasons it's a
military town, since it's naturally fortified. There are only two main roads
into the city, and they're going to have tight security regardless.

Dagan: You said main roads. So does that mean-

Asra: Yes. I took the liberty of driving through some of the rockier terrain.
There are some less direct routes into the city through here. Mostly gangs use
them to smuggle in contraband.

Dagan: And border security doesn't know about it?

Asra: They don't care. Troops trade on the black market at least as much as any
of the civilians, so they're happy to turn a blind eye.

Thane: That's not exactly reassuring. You think a smuggler would pass up the
bounty on our heads?

Asra: Well, if it does come down to that, we can expect more of the same.
Running, hiding, killing. Not saying I'm looking forward to it, but it's nothing
we haven't already done.

[Asra parks the Vollmer and motions for the others to get out.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Invention of Television</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane picks up a newspaper and begins to read]

Thane: "Researchers use amplitude-modulated frequencies to transmit images via
cathode ray tubes. Visual broadcast media is expected to reach the market later
this year."

Dagan: I didn't understand half of that.

Asra: I'm surprised. Aren't you the one that's always saying education is worse
than it used to be?

Thane: (Not this again...)

Dagan: It is. People used to know history. They used to know how to think. Now
it's a mad rush to find the next science prodigy.

Asra: That's not fair. Who are you to decide what people should be learning? I
don't see you inventing anything.

Thane: Asra, don't-

Dagan: It's not about what I've invented, or what anyone's invented for that
matter. You two grow up practically illiterate and completely ignorant of your
own history, and then you think engineering is the only thing worth knowing.

Asra: Not everyone has to be like you, Dagan! Different people-

Dagan: Everyone needs to know why things are the way they are right now! You
can't raise a whole generation of engineers to be subservient workers that shirk
their collective responsibility as citizens and then complain about oppression.

Asra: What do you know about collective responsibility? Your own brother risked
his life in the Civil War and all you did was stand on the sidelines and watch!

Dagan: You'd know all about that, wouldn't you? Please, keep lecturing me about
a war you weren't even alive to witness.

Thane: Both of you shut up!

Asra: ...

Thane: You can argue as much as you want when we reach Debony, but until then,
put the drama aside and stay focused.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Passing Through Nenegi</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra leads the group through the city.]

Thane: How close are we to your old house?

Asra: Not very. We came in through the northwest side of the city and we're
headed due south. Our house was southeast by all the industrial factories.

Dagan: So much the better. I'll bet it's crawling with cops by now.

Thane: You really think so? It's been almost a year since Asra lived there.

Dagan: Better safe than sorry.

Asra: Honestly, we'd probably be safer if we were farther east. The military
base stretches all along the west border.

Thane: We could just go around and approach from the east.

Asra: Not worth the trouble. They're about to turn this city upside down looking
for us. We want to be out of here before that happens.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Meeting Vanna</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra leads the group to an apartment.]

Dagan: Who is this Vanna, anyway?

Asra: She was my parents' supplier here in Nenegi.

Thane: I didn't realize you had those kinds of connections.

Asra: What do you mean? Everyone has a supplier somewhere or other. My dad
wasn't a revolutionary but it's not like we were model citizens. I've known
Vanna since I was eleven.

Dagan: Hold on, how did your parents die in the Rega Massacre if you lived in
Nenegi?

Asra: They commuted to Rega every day for work. Dad got carried away with all
the fear mongering and insisted we live in Nenegi. Said it'd be safer.

Thane: Sounds like he was right.

Asra: Yeah. I was at home during the attack.

Thane: Did Vanna give you any help you after your parents passed?

Asra: I didn't really think to ask. When you offered for me to move in, all I
really had to do was pack my things and get a train ticket. But if you hadn't
been there, she's the next person I would have asked.

Dagan: So you're sure we can trust her?

Asra: She owes me a huge favor. I don't see her turning us down.

Dagan: I hope you know what you're doing. We're putting a lot of trust in her by
showing our faces.

Asra: Vanna was in Rega during the attack. Overseeing some shipments, I think.
Once the fighting started she tried to flee but she almost got blown up by a 
flat bomb. My mom saved her life, right before she died trying to save Dad.

[Asra knocks, and a woman opens the door, a pistol at each hip.]

Vanna: Asra. Didn't think I'd see you again. And you brought company, too.

Asra: Hey, Vanna. This is my partner Thane and his uncle Dagan. We need some
help.

Vanna: Could have guessed that one. Come in. The weapons stay by the door.

[Vanna waves the group inside, and after Asra nods, Thane and Dagan set their
guns down.]

Vanna: You scared the shit out of me showing up in those uniforms. I thought I
was getting raided until I recognized you. Speaking of... What's it been, a
year? Where have you been?

Asra: Gheni, ever since the Massacre.

Vanna: Makes sense. So, what do you need?

Asra: We're trying to get to the United Territories.

Vanna: Oh, fuck off. It's never the easy stuff with you, is it?

Asra: Does that mean you can't help us?

Vanna: (Sighs) I've got some friends that can help you. But right now it's past
curfew. Stay here for the night. I'll give you directions in the morning.

Thane: Thank you so much.

Asra: We actually made arrangements to stay with a friend. Would we be able to
use your telegraph to tell them we're not coming?

[Beat]

Vanna: I was taking care of some business in the study when you knocked. Give me
a few minutes to finish up first.

Asra: Of course. Take your time.

[Vanna enters her study and locks it behind her]

Dagan: What was that about?

Asra: (Whispers) Something's wrong. I think someone's here.

Thane: What? How do you know?

[Asra quietly walks to the door and picks up her gun. Thane and Dagan do the
same, exchanging concerned looks.]

Asra: Vanna doesn't dress like that unless she's meeting with some high-ranking
official. And I'm pretty sure only one of the guns she was carrying was hers;
she hates Pfangers.

Thane: Why does it matter that she's got someone else's gun?

Asra: We left our weapons at the door, remember? If Vanna didn't want us to know
she had a guest, she'd carry them both. Also, she asked where we'd been. So
she's pretending she doesn't know we're on the run.

Dagan: Pretending? The fiasco in Chalt just happened. I'm sure some people are
on the lookout for us, but someone that's not paying attention would honestly
have no idea we're here.

Asra: Vanna's always paying attention. She's constantly exchanging telegraphs
and staying up to date. There's no way she doesn't know about Chalt.

Thane: So what does that mean?

Asra: If someone else is here and she wants us to have our guard down? I'd guess
she's planning on turning us in.

Dagan: Then what the fuck are we doing here? You said we could trust her!

Asra: I wasn't expecting this!

Thane: Is there any chance these are false positives? Any other reason Vanna
would carry a gun she doesn't like, or the other stuff you mentioned? Or a good
reason for her to sell us out?

Asra: Maybe some really contrived reason? The most straightforward explanation
is some higher-up is pressuring her to turn us in.

Dagan: So why don't we just leave?

Asra: I'd rather be sure something's wrong before we subject ourselves to
another night of sneaking around after curfew.

Dagan: By the time we're sure it might be too late.

Thane: It might be too late already. The telegraph is in her study, right? They
might be calling for help right now.

Asra: If Vanna's trying to turn us in, she won't want us to leave. One of us
can open the front door while someone else stays inside and hides. When she
investigates, we can check the study to see if anyone is hiding there.

Dagan: And if the study really is empty?

Asra: (Shrugs) Then we come up with some lame excuse and have an awkward
situation.

Thane: Alright.

[Asra walks to the front door. Thane walks down the hall past the door to the
study. Asra opens the door; she and Dagan hide behind the doorway.]

[Vanna and officer run out, Thane tails officer. Dagan and Asra confront Vanna
head-on. Thane holds officer at gunpoint. Vanna incapacitates Dagan and Asra,
prompting Thane to shoot the officer. Vanna then holds Dagan and Asra at
gunpoint with each pistol.]

Asra: Ungrateful bitch. Your corpse should be rotting in Rega right now.

Vanna: This... This wasn't what I wanted! You just had to come at the worst
fucking time, didn't you?

[Asra glances at the officer.]

Asra: What, because of him? What's he going to do about it now? This is stupid.
Just let us leave. I'm begging you, Vanna. It doesn't have to be like this.

Vanna: It's too late to turn back. He just called in three units, and I will not
let it be known that I was complicit in-

[Thane empties several rounds into Vanna's chest. Vanna's guns fire wildly,
missing Dagan but hitting Asra in the arm.]

Dagan: Shit!

Thane: Asra! Are you okay?

Asra: Yeah, I'm... Fuck... Vanna... Thane... What the fuck!?

Thane: We're running out of time. Let me get you patched up.

[Asra looks at Vanna's corpse as Thane patches the wound.]

Asra: ... Vanna?

Dagan: You heard her. We need to move, now.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Capture</button>
<div class="content">

[A grenade explodes, throwing Asra to the ground, unconscious. As Thane kneels
next to her, gunshots erupt, forcing him and Dagan to flee to cover. An officer
rushes to grab her body.]

Thane: No!!

[Thane fires at the officer, forcing him back behind cover. A grenade is thrown
at Thane and Dagan. When the dust clears, two people are already dragging Asra
away.]

Thane: Asra!!

[Several officers start advancing on them. Thane fires at them.]

Dagan: We can't stay here!

Thane: We have to! 

Dagan: There's nothing we can do!

Thane: (This isn't happening. This can't be happening.)

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Regroup</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan come across a river.]

Dagan: Quick, into the water!

[They dive in and are swept away almost instantly. Eventually, they crawl up
onto the riverbank.]

Thane: What the fuck do we do now?

Dagan: Well... We need to get out of these clothes before hypothermia sets in.
I'd make a fire but we can't risk being caught.

Thane: (We have to go back. I can't leave her.)

[Thane and Dagan strip naked and wring out their clothes.]

Thane: There's a cave by that hill. Maybe we can spend the night in there?

Dagan: If anything's living in there, we're fucked.

Thane: If we stay out here, we're fucked.

Dagan: Fair enough.

[Thane and Dagan hang their clothes on branches, then get into the cave, which
is empty.]

Thane: It's fucking freezing in here.

Dagan: Can't be helped. We can either stay up all night or huddle together.

Thane: (I miss her already.)

[Thane cozies up to Dagan awkwardly.]

Thane: So what happens now?

Dagan: Didn't you say Asra's parents had planned to stow away once? We might be
able to do that.

Thane: I'm talking about Asra, you fuck.

Dagan: Are you asking me to tell you what you already know? There's nothing we
can do for her. She'll be interrogated, then executed. Our best bet is to head
for Rega.

Thane: I can't do that.

Dagan: You have to.

Thane: Then go without me.

Dagan: Thane, wake up! You're not some kind of superhero! Asra's probably in the
Nenegi Corrections Facility by now. Name one good plan for saving her.

Thane: ...

Dagan: Asra's parents wanted to be stowaways. What was their plan?

Thane: Supposedly the ships that run between Chemina and the United Territories
stay too close to the arctic circle for tropical barnacles to get stuck on them,
so that's how you know where you're going.

Dagan: Assuming you can get on the ship. Still, it's a start.

Thane: Does it matter whether or not we go to Debony?

Dagan: Distance is the key factor here. Every country in Kabel wants to get
their hands on Cheminan engineers. We can expect political asylum pretty much
anywhere, but the important part is getting there in one piece.

Thane: That's not what I meant.

Dagan: I know things look shitty now, but you can't let that distract you from
the fact that it really will be better there. I don't use this word often, but
try to have a little faith. At the very least, it's better than doing nothing.

Thane: What about Asra? How's anything going to be better without her?

Dagan: (Sigh) Asra is gone. If you can't accept that, neither of us are going to
be able to make it out of here.

Thane: Does that even matter anymore?

Dagan: Fine. You don't have to be reasonable right now. We can talk in the
morning.

Thane: Fuck... Fuck!

Dagan: If I had a choice, I'd give you some time to grieve, but we're really up
against a wall here. We should really get some sleep.

Thane: (I hope you're okay, wherever you are.)

<button class="collapsible">Deus Ex Machina</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane is running through a forest in the dark. His leg is bleeding, and
unseen pursuers draw closer. One of the pursuers opens fire, shooting him in
the back. Thane collapses. As he rolls over, he sees a soldier loom over him,
face obscured by a visor. They point their gun at him and fire.]

[Thane wakes with a start, naked and cold, to the sound of a civil defense siren
in the distance. Dagan is already awake.]

Dagan: Something's happening. We should take a look.

[There are explosions in the distance.]

Thane: This doesn't have anything to do with us, does it? Wait, what the...?
Those sound like flat bombs.

Dagan: An Erawan attack in Nenegi? That's unheard of.

[Thane picks up his clothes and puts them on.]

Thane: Mostly dry. Let's go see what's going on.

[Dagan gets dressed and they hike toward the noise. A massive walled city can be
seen in the distance, with armored vehicles swarming the perimeter.]

Dagan: Erawa's raiding the prison... No doubt trying to get their men back.

Thane: Is Asra in the middle of all that?

Dagan: I know I'm going to regret saying this, but... If you want to look for
her, this is as good a chance as we're ever going to get. Honestly, between
this and catching Somoza with his pants down, we've had more than our share of
freak coincidences.

Thane: We? You're offering to help?

Dagan: I know what she means to you. I know you won't forgive yourself if you
pass an opportunity like this.

Thane: You're not gonna tell me that my life is more important? Or that yours
is?

Dagan: You'd do this whether or not I came with, right?

Thane: Well, yeah.

Dagan: Neither of us are going to survive if we try to split up. So I'm sticking
with you. Besides, this is the only chance we're going to get. It's now or
never.

Thane: I... really appreciate that.

Dagan: Now that said, our chances of finding her are pretty dismal. We'll be
looking for a needle in a haystack, and even then she might not be here at all.

Thane: A small chance is better than no chance at all.

Dagan: I figured you'd say something like that. Just don't get too hopeful. If
things start to look bad, I'm going to run and escape with my life. I advise you
do the same.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Shoot: KNEW: Risto Somoza's Succesion
</button><div class="content">

[Thane picks up a newspaper.]

Dagan: This should be interesting. How do you think Somoza died? Random heart
attack? Rescuing orphans from a burning building?

Thane: (I really don't want to think about this right now.)

Thane: "The great leader Farid Somoza was shot by Erawan radicals while
delivering a speech in Chalt. He was rushed to the Cheminan Medical Center and
later pronounced dead. The primary suspect has been identified as Thane
Belikoff, an Erawan nationalist born to illegal alien and terrorist Phaedra
Stutz, who raised Belikoff with the intent of destabilizing our sovereign
nation from within."

Dagan: That's actually more clever than I expected. Good for them.

Thane: (Sigh) Wasn't sending Mom to the death camps enough? Did they have to
desecrate her memory, too?

Dagan: The ironic part is you actually were raised by a terrorist. They just
picked the wrong one.

Thane: "This morning, Risto Somoza was inaugurated in his father's place as the
new supreme leader. Thousands cheered as the lieutenant general was sworn in."

[Beat]

Thane: ... It really didn't matter, did it?

Dagan: Well, he is dead. If that's what you wanted, I suppose you have something
to be happy about.

Thane: But the war isn't over. People are still going to die. And Chemina's
still ruled under the same regime.

Dagan: If peace were as easy as killing the bad guy, it would have happened a
long time ago. I did tell you this would happen, didn't I?

Thane: Do you still think I shouldn't have done it?

Dagan: I never thought it was the wrong decision. Somoza deserved to die, I
just thought it would be suicide to kill him. "Miracle" isn't a strong enough
word to describe us getting out of there in one piece.

Thane: What do you mean, miracle? What about Asra!?

Dagan: Calm down. Asra was captured because Vanna set us up. We still got out of
Chalt safely.

Thane: I never really thought about that.

Dagan: Thane, has it really not hit you yet? Farid Somoza is responsible for the
deaths of millions of people, including both of your parents, and Asra's, too.
You killed him and lived to tell the tale. I don't know how much longer we'll be
able to keep ourselves alive, but you might as well pat yourself on the back
while you still can.

Thane: I... did this.

Dagan: Damn right you did.

Thane: (Sigh) Let's go find Asra.

Dagan: I hope you're not planning on making these suicide missions a habit.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">The Camps</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan approach the prison. A massive hole has been torn through one
of the walls. Further west, everything appears to be distorted.]

Dagan: What the fuck is that?

Thane: What the...? They pinched the whole city?

Dagan: Pinched?

Thane: Those distortions are called a pinch tunnel. It happens when evincers 
bend physical space to bring two locations closer. Like a temporary shortcut for
advancing and retreating quickly.

Dagan: Sounds like they went all in on this attack.

[Thane and Dagan get closer to the prison. They take cover behind a nearby
building.]

Dagan: There's something uncomfortably familiar about all this. Reminds me of
the Civil War.

Thane: (Where would Asra be? Would they lump her in with domestic terrorists?)

Dagan: Not the fighting itself, more just being a correspondent. Standing in the
middle of all the action without fighting on either side.

Thane: (Maybe they'll be too preoccupied with each other to notice us.)

[Thane and Dagan make their way into the prison, blending parallel with several
Cheminan soldiers. Inside, gunshots and explosions can be heard. The inside of
the compound is massive; less of a prison than a town with walls.]

Thane: This... is gigantic. Did you know about this?

Dagan: I knew about the camps, but this is...

[Skeletally thin prisoners cower as soldiers trade fire.]

Thane: It's not a prison. It's a walled city. How are we ever going to find
Asra in all of this? I feel like throwing up. This is too much.

Dagan: You sure you want to do this?

Thane: I'd die before I left her in a place like this.

Dagan: Right. We should make for one of the watchtowers first so we at least
know where we are.

Thane: Wait, is that...?

[Thane turns to an Erawan, then begins sprinting toward her.]

Thane: Mom!!

Dagan: What...

[Dagan chases after Thane, looking around to see if anyone is about to open
fire on them. Thane grabs the woman.]

Thane: Mom! It's me. It's your son. Mom!

[Dagan grabs Thane's face and forces him to make eye contact.]

Dagan: Thane, that's not Phaedra.

Thane: What are you-

Dagan: That's. Not. Your. Mother.

Thane: But she's right...

[Thane turns back to the shaken woman, realizing she's a complete stranger.]

Thane: I...

Dagan: What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you trying to get us killed?

Thane: ...

Dagan: I don't know what's happening to you right now, but if you can't
function, we're leaving. This is dangerous enough without you losing your mind.

[Thane blinks hard.]

Thane: No. I can do this. I have to.

Dagan: What's our first objective?

Thane: We're getting inside one of those watchtowers to get an idea of where we
are and where we should start looking.

Dagan: Alright, then. Let's go.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Mapping the Prison</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan make it up the watchtower.]

Thane: This is horrible.

Dagan: I was expecting this place to look smaller from a bird's eye view. This
is worse than anything I could have imagined.

Thane: ... And Mom died in a place like this.

Dagan: ... Yes, she did.

Thane: Looks like there's a pretty good distribution of buildings here. Offices,
factories, prison blocks, warehouses... That small building just below us looks
like it could contain prisoners. Might be a good place to start.

Dagan: All four of those buildings look like they could be living quarters. We
could hit them one after the other. If we don't find Asra by then... Well, we
can cross that bridge when we come to it.

Thane: Please be safe, wherever you are. We're coming.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">The Erawan Private</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane and Dagan walk through a prison block.]

Dagan: Sensory Deprivation Block? What's that?

Thane: They explained these when I was in training. It's how evincers are
prevented from using their powers to escape.

Dagan: So there's a prisoner in here?

[Dagan approaches a tank and slides open a porthole.]

Thane: Hey, don't-

[The porthole glows with white light, then begins to rock back and forth
violently before different components are thrown across the room with an
ear-splitting sound.]

Dagan: Holy shit!

Thane: Dagan! Are you alright?

Dagan: My ears are ringing, but I'm fine. What just happened?

Thane: That tank keeps prisoners from using their powers to escape. They block
all stimuli.

Dagan: Wait, you mean...

[The dust clears, revealing an Erawan man. He looks toward Dagan, then staggers
to a piece of debris and picks it up, shrinking it in preparation.]

Prisoner: Cheminan!

Thane: Wait! We're not military!

Prisoner: You expect me to believe that?

Thane: (in Erawan) My mother was Erawan.

Prisoner: Then who are you?

Thane: I'm Thane. This is Dagan. We're trying to rescue someone.

[The man appears to calm himself down.]

Peleg: I'm Peleg, Private of Erawa's 3rd Battalion. Thane... You are looking for
your mother?

Thane: No, someone else. My mother is... gone.

Peleg: There is someone here I must find as well. Finding her is my first
priority. I know this prison well. If you protect me, I can guide you.

Thane: Really? That's... thank you, so much.

Peleg: But just to be sure... If I'm killed or knocked unconscious, this will
trigger automatically and kill both of you.

[Peleg waves his flatbomb before tucking it under his clothes.]

Dagan: Erawan soldiers are storming the prison right now. This place is a
warzone. One stray bullet could hit you and we'd all be toast. Fuck that.

Peleg: I have no reason to trust you. That is my offer. Take it or leave it.

Dagan: Shitty offer.

Thane: We don't know where we're going. He does.

Dagan: ... Fine.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Pronsi</button>
<div class="content">

[Peleg surveys the battleground that is the prison town, then points into the
distance.]

Peleg: There's a warehouse full of Pronsi just north of here. We should grab
some while all the guards are busy fighting.

Dagan: Pronsi?

Peleg: You don't know? It's a stimulant designed to kill from withdrawal. Here
in the prison it's used as a sort of currency to keep people under control.

Thane: Currency? You mean if you don't work they'll just let you keel over and
die?

Dagan: You just described Somoza's regime in one sentence.

Peleg: Well, it's not just Chemina. Debony uses it on slave miners in Lamenir.

Dagan: I assume you want enough to survive after you escape?

Peleg: No, not for me. For a cellmate. Back when I was first captured I had a
broken arm and couldn't work. She gave me half of the Pronsi she earned until I
healed.

Thane: Wait, but if you're not taking any for yourself, does that mean you're
just gonna let the drug kill you?

Peleg: It depends on how much is in that warehouse. But it kills everyone
eventually. The best you can do is buy time, and in this case, we'll have to
ration it between three people.

Thane: Three?

Peleg: Your friend will need some too.

Thane: Asra? I... Oh no. She was only captured yesterday. Maybe there's still
time?

Dagan: They're probably planning to execute her. If that's the case, I doubt
they'd bother with something like that.

Peleg: Yesterday? You're very lucky to have made it here so soon.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Common Ground</button>
<div class="content">

[The group approaches the warehouse.]

Peleg: The warehouse uses an electronic lock. It's how they keep the prisoners
from evincing the door open.

Dagan: I don't see any power lines.

Peleg: The power runs underground so it's nearly impossible to cut it off from
the source.

Thane: So what's your plan for getting in?

Peleg: If the building draws too much power, it'll trip the circuit breakers.

[Peleg faces a flood lamp outside the warehouse. It flickers on, glows brighter,
then makes a loud pop and burns out. He casually approaches the warehouse and
opens it. The three of them enter the warehouse.]

Thane: For being Erawan, you know a lot about Cheminan technology.

Peleg: I should hope so. I spent a year abroad studying history at the
University of Gheni.

Thane: Wait, that's where I'm from! I studied engineering there!

Peleg: For real? I don't suppose you were in Loden Dorms?

Thane: No, I lived close enough that I didn't need university housing. I had a
few friends in Loden though. So, how'd you end up in prison?

Peleg: My main field of study was foreign relations. I was interested in opening
trade routes with Chemina. The Divine Ministry didn't like that, so they stuck
me on the battlefield instead.

Dagan: Figures. Thane's mother came to Chemina to get away from that kind of
leadership. Then Somoza took power and it wasn't any better here, either.

[Peleg grabs a handful of bottles from a shelf, before opening one and dry
swallowing a pill.]

Peleg: Finally, some good news. This'll last for years. Grab as much of it as
you can. We're hitting the prison block.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Breaking Point</button>
<div class="content">

[The group walks through the prison, checking the cells one at a time.]

Thane: I'm surprised there's no one here. Isn't the whole point of the attack to
free the prisoners?

Peleg: Not these prisoners. This block is all Cheminan, so your friend should be
here too.

Thane: Wait, so the person you're looking for is Cheminan?

Peleg: Yes. The only reason we shared a cell is that we were both being
experimented on. When the Ribatol made her sick, they transferred her here. And
when I got too strong, they stuck me in Sensory Deprivation.

Thane: And that's why you're so powerful?

[Dagan approaches a door without a porthole.]

Dagan: Hey, this one looks different.

[Thane approaches the door and evinces it open. Inside is a torture rack and
electrical equipment.]

Thane: Ugh...

Peleg: I can't... Not again...

[Thane turns to see Peleg crumple to the ground, screaming. He then turns to see
a second Peleg on the rack, a prison guard torturing him with electricity.]

Peleg: No! NO!!

Dagan: What... what the fuck's going on?

Thane: I don't know!

[Thane runs over to the guard torturing Peleg on the rack, then looks back at
the first Peleg just as he falls unconscious.]

Dagan: Thane, the flat-

[A massive explosion shakes the room, throwing Thane against the wall. When he
looks around, the rack is empty and the guard is gone. Peleg is dead, and Dagan
lies in a pool of his own blood. Thane rushes to Dagan and begins tearing out
some bandages.]

Thane: Dagan! I've got you! Hold on!

Dagan: I... Thane, you can't be serious. Look at me.

Thane: You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay.

Dagan: No, I'm not.

Thane: No! Fuck you, the reason I came here in the first place was so we could
all escape Chemina together. I'm not leaving you! I... I can't do this alone...

Dagan: You don't have a choice. So suck it up and get out of here.

[Thane pushes up Dagan's shirt. His chest is pelleted with debris from the flat
bomb.]

Thane: Keep talking. I'll get you out of here.

[Dagan's voice slowly becomes weaker and raspier.]

Dagan: Stop ignoring me.

[Thane puts Dagan's arm over one of the wounds and presses.]

Thane: Keep as much pressure here as you can. I'm going to dress the wound.
We're getting out of here together. This is non-negotiable. Dagan? Dagan, stay
with me! Dagan! Fucking wake up! Wake up! You can't die!

[Thane continues pressing on one of the bandaged wounds. Tears begin to form.]

Thane: This isn't happening. Dagan, please. I can't do this alone. I can't. I
can't. Please, I'm begging you.

[Beat]

Thane: No... No! Dagan! Don't leave me!

[Thane collapses in tears. After some time, Thane's hand closes around his gun.
He points the barrel under his chin and closes his eyes.]

Thane: (Whispering) I can't do this... I can't do this... I can't... Fuck...

[Thane begins hyperventilating. He forces himself to hold his breath... and
hears a voice call out in the distance.]

Asra: Thane? Is that you?

Thane: What...? Asra?

[Thane looks down at Dagan, then gets up and sprints toward the noise. He
arrives at a heavy metal door.]

Thane: Asra!

Asra: Thane, what are you doing here?

Thane: I'll explain in a minute. Hold on.

[Thane yanks on the door.]

Thane: Shit! Come on, think...

[Thane presses his hand against the door and closes his eyes. The door opens on
its own.]

Asra: Whoa. How did you do that?

Thane: Hold on. Dagan's hurt.

[Thane and Asra rush out to kneel beside Dagan.]

Asra: He's fading, but there's still a pulse. What he needs is rest.

Thane: It'll have to wait. We need to move now.

Asra: Yeah, I figured.

[Thane turns to Asra, and the two embrace.]

Thane: I was so scared. I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

Asra: Yeah, me too.

Thane: I'll never let you out of my sight again. I promise.

[Asra kisses Thane on the cheek before turning back to Dagan.]

Asra: Let's get him up.

[Asra and Thane hoist Dagan to his feet. Dagan stirs slightly.]

Dagan: Shit, I'm still alive?

Asra: Don't sound so disappointed. How are you feeling?

Dagan: Awful.

Thane: Well, let's get you up. We're not out of the woods yet.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">A Mount</button>
<div class="content">

[Multiple Vollmers are now roll through the prison. Erawans and Cheminans
exchange fire. The breach in the wall is heavily fortified with Cheminan
forces.]

Asra: You went through all this to find me? Thane, you're really stupid, you
know that?

Thane: You're welcome.

Dagan: Any ideas for how we're getting out of here?

[Beat]

Thane: The pinch tunnel! We can use it to escape!

Dagan: You sure we'll make it in one piece?

Thane: I think so. It's almost impossible to get a straight shot in one of them.

[The trio approaches the breach in the wall cautiously, passing Cheminan
soldiers who mostly ignore them.]

Thane: Alright, think we make it from here?

Asra: Yeah.

Thane: Alright, move!

[The group charges as quickly as they can into the center of the distortion.
The city of Nenegi passes in a strange blur, then suddenly gives way to tropical
forest.]

Thane: We should be far enough. Here, follow me!

[Thane turns left and runs directly back into the wall of distortion. On the
other side, the forest appears clear and normal.]

## CHAPTER 5: TRIPSI ##
#######################

<button class="collapsible">Behind Enemy Lines</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio walk throurgh a forest, then slow to a stop.]

Dagan: This is Erawa?

Thane: Has to be. Chemina never gets this warm.

Asra: Never thought I'd end up here again.

Thane: Yeah, me neither.

[They emerge from the trees into the ruins of a small village.]

Thane: I haven't been to Tripsi in almost five years... This place is in utter
ruin.

Soldier: (in Erawan) The enemy!

[Erawans begin throwing flat bombs at the trio.]

Asra: You've gotta be kidding me!

Thane: (in Erawan) Leave us alone, damn it!

Soldier: (in Erawan) Die, Cheminan scum!

Dagan: What are you waiting for!? Move it!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Stranger</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio is fleeing from an Erawan with a gun. The Erawan is shot from behind,
and a Cheminan soldier approaches. Thane raises his gun.]

Cheminan: Whoa, calm down! I'm on your side!

[Thane lowers his gun.]

Thane: ... Sorry.

Cheminan: You alright? You look like shit.

Thane: Yeah.

[The Cheminan offers a hand to Thane, but he refuses and stands on his own.]

Cheminan: Didn't think there were any of us left out here. I don't recognize you
from our unit. Who are you?

Thane: You don't know who I am?

Dagan: You just had to ask, didn't you?

Cheminan: Am I supposed to? I don't recall Jaromir sending any celebrities on a
counterassault mission.

Thane: I'm not a celebrity, I... Call me Jin.

Flint: I'm Flint. So, how'd you end up out here alone?

Thane: I'm not alone.

Flint: You know what I mean. Where's the rest of your platoon?

Thane: It's a long story.

Flint: Can't have been too long. The Erawan assault just happened.

Thane: I don't want to talk about it.

Flint: Suit yourself. As for me, the enemy baited our Vollmer into a ditch. All
went downhill from there, no pun intended. We scattered and broke formation. Not
sure what happened to everyone else.

Thane: Anything can happen in a pinch tunnel. Two steps in the wrong direction
could put you miles away from the rest of your team.

Dagan: Sounds like all of us are lucky to be alive.

Flint: How about we go try and round up whoever's left?

Thane: I can't do that. There's something I need to handle on my own.

Flint: Are you nuts? You won't make it alone.

Thane: Please, back off.

[Beat]

Flint: Well, I suppose I can't force you.

Thane: I'm going to go now.

Flint: Alright. Be safe out there.

[The trio walks away.]

Asra: That was close. We're really lucky he didn't know who we were.

Thane: Maybe he does. Keep an eye out in case he decides to follow us.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Bad Blood</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio make their way into an abandoned house.]

Dagan: You really think we'll find anything in here?

Thane: I doubt we'll find food, but at the very least it should make for decent
shelter. I don't have the energy to do anything else today.

[Thane enters the kitchen and sees fresh fruit in a bowl on the table.]

Thane: This stuff can't be more than a few days old.

Asra: I don't like this one bit. We should-

Old Man: (in Erawan) Cheminan!

Thane: What-

Old Man: (in Erawan) Haven't you taken enough from us already?

Thane: (in Erawan) Wait! I'm not-

[The man grabs a knife from the counter, fashions it into a flatbomb, and throws
it.]

Asra: Look out!

Old Man: (in Erawan) Die!

[Thane reflexively raises his hand and deflects the knife, which bounces back
toward the man.]

Thane: No!

Old Man: (in Erawan) How-

[Thane tackles Asra to the floor just as it explodes violently.]

Thane: Is everyone okay?

Dagan: Still alive.

Asra: What... just happened?

[The trio get back up. The old man is dead, a shard of metal embedded in his
forehead.]

Thane: He tried to kill us with a flat bomb... And I tried to delay the
explosion. I guess it worked.

Asra: You can do that?

Thane: I... I did it without thinking.

[As Dagan surveys the man's wounds, a teenage boy enters the kitchen from
another room.]

Boy: (in Erawan) Dad!

[The boy looks at Thane, then screams and starts attacking him with his fists.]

Boy: (in Erawan) Killer! Why won't you people just leave us alone!?

[Thane tries to push the boy away. The boy persists, and Thane fires warning
shots from his gun, causing the boy to fall silent, then flee the house.]

Thane: Fuck.

[Thane sits down on the floor, leaning on the wall, and breaks down crying.]

Thane: I can't take this anymore! Why did any of this have to happen? None of
this would have happened if we'd just gone somewhere else!

Asra: You need to keep moving. Come on.

[Thane leans over the man.]

Thane: I'm so sorry. You never asked for this. I didn't mean to...

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Family Ties</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio enter another old house, Thane holding a flashlight.]

Dagan: This place looks like bad news.

Thane: We don't have a choice. Sooner or later we need to find somewhere to
spend the night.

[As they make their way through a hall, a door opens and a woman steps out.]

Thane: (in Erawan) Get back!

Woman: (in Erawan) What...?

Thane: (in Erawan) I said get the fuck away from me!

Woman: (in Erawan) Are you okay? You look terrible.

[Thane pauses before answering. He sounds less panicked, but still tense.]

Thane: (in Erawan) We were just looking for a place to sleep. I didn't realize
someone was living here. Please just let us leave.

Woman: (in Erawan) You can stay here. You'll be safe for the night.

Thane: (in Erawan) ... What?

Woman: (in Erawan) That's what you need, isn't it?

Thane: (in Erawan) Yes, but-

Oda: (in Erawan) Then make yourself at home. There's too few of us left here in
this town for us not to take care of each other.

Thane: (in Erawan) But... we're Cheminan.

Oda: (in Erawan) Doesn't make much difference to me. If you wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead already, right? I'm Oda, by the way. Oda Stutz. And you are?

[Thane takes several deep breaths and tries to calm himself.]

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm Thane Belikoff.

Asra: Asra Sacco. It's a pleasure to meet you.

Dagan: Dagan Belikoff.

Oda: (in Erawan) Belikoff? I don't suppose you know a man named Saito by any
chance?

Thane: (in Erawan) What...? That's my father!

Oda: (in Erawan) I see. Then you are Phaedra's son?

Thane: (in Erawan) Who... are you?

Oda: (in Erawan) Phaedra is my little sister. How is she doing?

Thane: My mother was... taken away. I haven't seen her since I was little.

Oda: (in Erawan) I should have expected as much. When your mother defected to
Chemina, I was imprisoned as punishment, as was the rest of the family. I was
afraid to contact her after that.

Thane: (in Erawan) How did you end up in Tripsi? Aren't you from Merad?

Oda: (in Erawan) The locals of Merad were not kind to me when I was released.
I had nothing, so this was where I ended up. The rest the family was... less
fortunate.

Thane: (in Erawan) I'm so sorry.

Oda: (in Erawan) I suppose I should ask what you're doing here in Erawa.

Thane: (in Erawan) We were trying to escape to Debony but we got a bit
sidetracked. It's a long story.

Oda: (in Erawan) I guess the grass is always greener on the other side, isn't
it? First my sister runs off to Chemina, and now you're trying to escape, too.

Thane: (in Erawan) A lot changed since Somoza won the war. At least, that's what
my dad told me. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

Oda: (in Erawan) I would love to, Thane. Trust me, I would. But there's no
country in Kabel that wants to take in an Erawan refugee. Besides, it looks like
you've had quite the adventure. I doubt I'm in good enough health for that sort
of thing.

Dagan: She's probably right. Even I'm going to have a hard time convincing the
Debonese government to let me stay.

Thane: ...

Oda: (in Erawan) Go get some rest. I can tell you need it.

<button class="collapsible">Reminiscing About Vanna</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio settle down in a small room, Thane and Asra on a bed. Dagan sleeps in
an armchair.]

Asra: I've been thinking. About killing.

Thane: Yeah?

Asra: Ever since you killed Vanna... I don't know, the weight of what that
actually means is more clear now. It doesn't feel good anymore. And I think
that's a good thing.

Thane: I guess I forgot how close you were with her.

[Beat]

Asra: Vanna had a little sister. A medic, like me. She died before I was born,
but Vanna talked about her. When the Civil War broke out, she treated people on
both sides, even though Vanna begged her to stay home instead. One day Somoza's
men gunned down the medical tent and that was that.

[Beat]

Asra: Sometimes it felt like Vanna wanted me to replace her. Like if I could be
tougher than she was, Vanna would feel better about not doing more for her
sister.

Thane: I think you told me most of this before, and I stand by what I said then.
There's nothing Vanna could have done. Her sister chose her own path. No one
else can take responsibility for that.

Asra: I think she knew that. But she still felt guilty anyway, even though she
acted tough.

Thane: Dagan's the same way. He and Mom were really close. Like, looking back as
an adult I'm pretty sure they had a thing. When she was taken away, something
about him changed. He was always kind of strict, but there were several years
after Mom left when I was actually afraid of him. I guess losing someone you
love can do that to you.

Asra: But Dagan still wanted to stay neutral?

Thane: (Sigh) Mom... wanted to be turned in. You remember Dagan talking about
how they killed kids just because their parents were dissidents? I was almost
one of those. Mom said if Dad turned her in, it would prove I was being "raised
right."

[Beat]

Thane: Now Dad's gone, it's making me think... Everyone's made these sacrifices
for me, and it's like... why? So I can get my head blown off trying jumping the
border? What's all of this for? Am I really worth that much more than everyone
else? I don't feel like I am.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Nightmare</button>
<div class="content">

[Asra stands on a gallows in a line of prisoners. There are tears in her eyes.
Thane stands in a crowd, pushing his way to the front.]

Thane: Wait! Please, I'm begging you!

[People in the crowd shove him back angrily. The executioner begins opening the
trapdoors of prisoners one at a time.]

Thane: Asra!!

[Thane forces the last person away, draws his gun and aims at the executioner.
There are no bullets in his gun.]

Asra: I'm sorry, Thane.

[Soldiers grab Thane from both sides before he can climb onto the platform.]

Thane: No!

[The platform below Asra opens, and she falls. Thane wakes with a start,
breathing heavily. Dagan and Asra lay beside him.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Goodbye Oda</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio prepare to leave.]

Oda: (in Erawan) Where are you headed?

Thane: (in Erawan) Back toward the border. I'm heading for Rega.

Oda: (in Erawan) You're headed south, then. What did your mother tell you about
the Lucinde tribe?

Thane: (in Erawan) Uhh... She said they're poor and live farther from the
Fracture. The Igrid clergy are usually more powerful evincers, and they treat
the Lucinde like dirt.

[Oda nods.]

Oda: (in Erawan) It's a life of poverty here, and often crime. War has made
Tripsi especially bad. You should be careful of anyone you come across,
especially in that uniform. If the Lucinde Mafia sees you they might shoot you
on sight.

Thane: (in Erawan) Shoot? Like with guns?

Oda: (in Erawan) Yes. It's common for them to comb through corpses after battles
looking for Cheminan weapons.

Thane: (in Erawan) So they'll be fighting me using flat bombs and guns?

Oda: (in Erawan) Please avoid fighting if you can. Most of them are just kids.

Thane: (in Erawan) You said they might shoot me on sight.

Oda: (in Erawan) You have to understand that between the Igrid tribe and being
invaded by the Cheminan military, these children have lost everything.

Thane: (in Erawan) Okay, but what am I supposed to do if I'm being shot at!?

[Beat]

Oda: (in Erawan) If you can, run. If you can't... I suppose you'll do what you
have to.

Thane (in Erawan): I'll be careful. Thank you so much for everything.

Oda (in Erawan): No, thank you. It was a blessing to meet my nephew, and to know
what happened to my sister... Even if she is gone. Be safe, Thane.

[Oda and Thane embrace. The trio leaves Oda's house and heads south.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Erawan Gangs</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio walks through the ruins of Tripsi. A two teenage boys approach them.]

Teen 1: Hey!

[Asra and Dagan exchange glances. Thane ignores him and continues walking.]

Teen 1: Hey, I'm talking to you!

Teen 2: Maybe he only likes killing old people.

[Thane stops walking but says nothing.]

Asra: Uh, Thane?

Teen 1: Listen to me, bitch!

Teen 2: (in Erawan) I think he's deaf.

Teen 1: (in Erawan) Let's blow his head off.

[The two teenagers pace in a slow circle around the trio.]

Dagan: Thane, they're gonna kill you. Do something!

Thane: (in Erawan) Leave me alone.

Teen 2: You think you're smart, speaking our language?

Teen 1: (Mocking) Chemina leads the future! (in Erawan) Fucking cockroach!

[The teen spits at Thane.]

Thane: Leave me alone!

Team 2: Why? So you can kill our parents, too? Fuck you!

Thane: I didn't kill him! He blew himself up!

Team 1: (Laughs) You expect me to believe that?

[Thane starts walking again.]

Team 2: (in Erawan) Fuck him up!

[Two more kids, both with guns, jump out from behind a shelled hut and open
fire on Thane. Thane runs for cover.]

Team 2: Run, bitch, run!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Collateral Damage</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane approaches the gang leader on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound.]

Teen: (in Erawan) Wait, wait! Please don't kill me. I don't want to die.

Dagan: Don't fall for it! He'll kill you if you give him an inch!

Asra: He's already done for. Finish it already.

Thane: I don't...

Dagan: Do it! Now!

[Thane shoots the gang leader, then sinks to his knees and drops his gun in
despair.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Border Security</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio sees a checkpoint ahead.]

Dagan: How do you plan on making it across the border? Security in Rega is
already high, but after the attack on Nenegi there's no way we'll make it
across.

Asra: We're all Cheminan, aren't we? We can just say we were taken prisoner and
escaped.

Dagan: So what happens after that? Cheminan or not, we're dead as soon as they
identify us.

Asra: They're probably not expecting us in Rega. Maybe that's good enough? Or
we could just bribe them.

Dagan: That's not going to work.

Thane: Actually... I just had an idea.

[Thane pulls a locket from his pack and opens it. One half contains a photo of
Saito. The other is a mirror.]

Asra: What are you doing?

Thane: You know those illusions where you stare at something for ten seconds and
the image gets burned into your eyes?

Asra: Yeah, I think it's called iconic memory? Wait, you said illusion. Does
that mean you can use evincing to disguise yourself?

Thane: It's worth a shot.

[Thane stares at the photo of Saito, then into the mirror. After a few tries,
he takes on Saito's appearance.]

Thane: Hopefully this lasts long enough for us to cross the border. But what
about you two?

Asra: Wait, I know!

[Asra digs around in her pack and pulls out a wallet taken from a fallen
soldier. Thane takes it and removes an ID card and family photograph.]

Thane: Alright, stand still.

[Thane repeats the process with both Asra and Dagan.]

Dagan: Did it work?

Thane: Yes, but try not to look at each other. If you expect to see each others'
normal faces it might undo the change.

Dagan: What about when border security looks at us?

Thane: They don't know what we're supposed to look like, so it shouldn't matter.

[The trio finally approach the checkpoint and are greeted by border security.]

Guard: You look like shit. Where are you coming from?

Thane: There was a prison break in Merad. We barely escaped with our lives.

[The guard looks at Thane suspiciously.]

Guard: And you were the only one that made it out?

Thane: Just us, yeah.

Guard: "Us?"

Thane: Yeah.

Guard: Name and identification?

Thane: My name is Jin Knox. Our IDs were confiscated when we were captured.

Guard: No one crosses without identification.

Thane: Alright then. How about this?

[Thane hands the guard a stack of lauves.]

Guard: Welcome to Chemina.

[As the trio cross the border, Dagan and Asra glance at each other. Their faces
begin to change back.]

<button class="collapsible">Rebellion</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio pass a man, who approaches Thane.]

Man: Excuse me, do you have a moment?

Dagan: We don't.

Orric: My name is Orric. I'm here on behalf of a group of people like
yourselves - young men and women committed to change.

Thane: I'm not interested.

Orric: Really? I think you're just the type-

Thane: Not interested. Fuck off.

Orric: I know who you are, Belikoff.

Thane: What do you want?

Orric: Calm down. If I had any intention of turning you in, do you really
think I would be confronting you like this? I know you're armed and dangerous,
but I'm approaching you alone and unarmed. Do I look like I want a fight?

Dagan: Why are you looking for us here? Why are you looking for us at all?

Orric: We have ears in many places.

Orric: You must understand why the assassins of Farid Somoza would draw my
interest, especially given that you were able to destroy the airship deployed
immediately after. Moreover...

Orric: The ability to defeat and commandeer a Vollmer on foot is not likely
to escape our interest. I decided to track you down because we need people like
you on our side.

Thane: Everything we did was out of self-preservation and opportunism. Stop
trying to recruit us into your little group. We're not interested. Get out of my
face.

Orric: You're in Rega because you're planning to stow away on a cargo ship,
yes?

Thane: ...

Orric: The port is closed until tomorrow. I can offer you shelter for the
night. All I ask in return is that you listen to what I have to say.

Asra: Why should we trust you?

Orric: That again? I already told you, I wouldn't approach you like this if
I were a bounty hunter. Besides, the police are after me, too.

Thane: ...

Orric: Not in the mood to talk? That's fine. I'm going back to our base. If
you're interested, follow.

Dagan: Got any better ideas?

Thane: Unfortunately, no.

[The trio follow Orric into the ruins of the Rega massacre.]

Thane: All this destruction...

Asra: Mom... Dad...

Orric: You're Asra, yes? I wasn't aware you had family here. I'm sorry for
your loss. Are you from Rega?

Asra: Nenegi. My parents worked here.

Orric: I see.

Thane: Why wouldn't they just build a memorial over the ruins? This is...

Dagan: Depressing? I imagine that's on purpose. These shelled buildings are a
reminder of the constant threat. It keeps people afraid.

[Orric leads the group past a locked grated door and into the sewer system.
Thane turns on his flashlight and looks around.]

Dagan: Your organization is stationed here?

Orric: Surprised? These sewers give us access to much of the city while
keeping us out of sight. And since we're under the ruins, we can escape to
street level without being immediately surrounded.

[The group is led to a small room with a bare mattress.]

Orric: I'm afraid this is all we have. It's not much, but it's safe and dry.

Thane: Thank you.

Orric: It's late, and I have some business to attend to. I've held my half
of the deal. We can discuss the other half tomorrow.

[Orric leaves the trio alone.]

Dagan: I don't like this. We're too vulnerable here.

Thane: We'd be just as vulnerable anywhere else.

Asra: We have no idea who these people are!

Thane: What's your alternative, then?

Asra: I don't know, but we'll be sitting ducks if anyone comes in here while
we're asleep.

[Thane pulls two cans of food out of his pack and stacks them in front of the
door.]

Thane: There. At least we'll know if someone comes in.

Dagan: (Sigh) Better than nothing.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Extortion</button>
<div class="content">

[Dagan lies on the floor of the Nenegi prison, twitching as he bleeds to death.
Thane leans over his body.]

Thane: Dagan, please... Don't leave me. It can't end here. Not after we've come
so far.

[A figure approaches. It's Asra, with an eerie grin and blood on her face. She
points a gun at Dagan and shoots him, then aims at Thane and shoots again. 
Thane awakens with a start.]

[Later, the trio sit on a dingy bed, sharing a can of pork and beans.]

Thane: I can't believe we're almost there. We could be at sea before sunset.

Dagan: If we don't get blown to bits first.

Asra: It's about time we started travelling before curfew. This whole adventure
has been a train wreck.

Thane: One way or another, it'll be over soon.

Asra: Thane, I know it's kind of early to talk about this but...

Thane: Yes?

Asra: When we escape, would you want things to be more serious?

Thane: You mean marriage?

Asra: Yeah. I don't want to rush you if you aren't ready yet.

Thane: No, I'm ready. If we make it to Debony, I think... I think it would make
sense.

Asra: If that isn't motivation, I don't know what is.

[Orric enters the room, then closes the door behind him.]

Orric: Sleep well?

Thane: Well enough. 

Orric: As I said earlier, I would have you listen to my offer. A small price
to pay for shelter, I think.

Asra: Are you a terrorist organization?

[Orric scowls.]

Orric: Suppose a group of armed men can stop you, search you, and take your
property or even your life just because they feel like it. If that sounds like
terrorism to you, consider us a counterterrorism unit. We're sick of this
pointless war. We're sick of Somoza's draconic labor camps, kin punishment,
public execution, and constant surveillance. We aim to overthrow the regime and
give the country back to its people.

Dagan: You guys must have a death wish.

Orric: I would rather die fighting for myself and my loved ones than for a
dictator sending me off to kill strangers.

Asra: I understand why you're doing this. I felt the same way for a long time.
But I've started to imagine how easy it would be to just run away instead. What
use are vengeance or freedom if you're not around to enjoy them?

Thane: I'm surprised. I mean, you really wanted me to kill Somoza.

Asra: To be honest, I'm surprised too. For a while I kept having this back and
forth... I wanted to see the big picture, but the more I fought, the more it was
turning me into someone else.

Thane: I think I understand.

Asra: It was also easy to tell myself that nothing was certain, like escape was
a far away pipe dream. But we're so close now, and I can't throw that away.

Orric: Have the two of you made the same decision as well?

Dagan: My priority was always to leave the country as soon as possible. That
hasn't changed.

Thane: Likewise.

Orric: I will ask one last time. This is a chance to be part of something
larger than yourselves, to fight back when before you could only run and hide.
You've been fighting for yourselves. This is a chance to fight for others.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

Asra: One of my best friends ratted me out to claim a bounty on my head. If it
weren't for Thane I'd have been executed. The idealism is charming, but I'd
rather protect people I know I can trust. And starting a revolution isn't my
idea of protecting anyone.

Thane: Same goes for me. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I have too
much to live for to gamble it away like this. So if you don't mind, the three of 
us will be on our way now.

Orric: Most unfortunate. I hoped it would not come to this, but you leave me
no other choice. This is my final offer. You join us, or we turn you in.

[Orric draws a pistol.]

Asra: Is this some kind of bad joke? The police are hunting you, too.

Orric: Not all of us.

Dagan: And you think we won't expose your little operation if you do?

Orric: Why do you think we're not letting you leave? Either way you'd
expose us under torture if you were captured. If you really won't join us, we'll
turn in your corpses.

Thane: You're making a big mistake.

Orric: No, you are. I'm offering the choice between fighting an abusive
dictatorship and forcing your hand against men and women that only want the same
thing you do. It is not too late to reconsider your options.

Dagan: You're not as charming as you think you are. But if I'm not in a position
to refuse, I won't try. State your conditions.

Orric: I knew you would come to your senses. Come with me. I'd like you to
meet some of our friends.

[Orric motions for the trio to walk in front of them, gun to their backs.
When Thane opens the door, the cans of food clatter on the floor. They leave.]

Asra: Well this sucks.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Rebel Mission</button>
<div class="content">

[Orric leads the group to a junction in the sewers, containing several
people sitting around and talking.]

Orric: Morning, Kilan.

Kilan: Hey. I take it these are the guys?

Orric: Yeah, and they agreed to join us, too.

Dagan: Hey-

Kilan: That's excellent. I'm told you guys really know what you're doing. I'm
Kilan, by the way.

Thane: Uh...

[Kilan offers a hand to the trio. Dagan shakes his hand awkwardly. Asra
refuses.]

Orric: I'd like for them to accompany you and Seraphim to the Rega Coal Plant.

Seraphim: On their first day here? You can't be serious. We don't even know who
these people are! Something this important-

Orric: Something this important needs all hands on deck. We're short on
manpower and these three will make a critical difference.

Seraphim: And you're sure we can trust them?

Orric: You're better off with them than without them, if that's your
concern. I trust you and Kilan can hold your own if something goes wrong.

Kilan: I can take care of myself.

Thane: Mind telling us what this is all about?

Seraphim: We're blowing up a coal plant.

Thane: Wait, what? Five people for a whole power plant? Are you insane!?

Orric: Contain yourself. Somoza always stages attacks on Cheminan soil
before drafting more soldiers. That means he's drawing resources away from
everything else, including domestic security. Five of us should be enough.

Dagan: Hold on. What do you mean, "stages attacks?"

Orric: The assault on Nenegi Corrections Facility, of course. You don't
actually think Erawa was behind that, do you?

Thane: The attackers were Erawan. We were there. We saw them.

Orric: Erawan mercenaries. On Somoza's payroll, of course. Certainly not
conventional military.

Thane: Hold on-

Asra: You make it sound like Somoza's done this before. Did he have anything to
do with the Rega Massacre?

Orric: Ah... I'd forgotten how your parents died. Yes, that was Somoza's work as
well.

Asra: ...

Seraphim: If you're serious about sending them, we'd better give them a
briefing.

Kilan: I can help with that. So did Orric tell you these sewers run under
the whole city?

Thane: He mentioned something like that.

Kilan: Okay, good. That's our main method of getting around without being seen.
There's a tunnel that leads pretty close to it. Orric is going to wait about an
hour and set off some charges on the other side of town as a distraction. That's
when we blast our way in. We hit hard and fast, then we get the fuck out. Make
sense?

Thane: Yeah.

Seraphim: We'll be handling the pyrotechnics, so you three will be providing
support fire. We're spreading the enemy as thin as we can, but don't expect this
to be a cakewalk. Any questions?

Dagan: Yeah, what happens when we're done?

Orric: We can discuss the specifics afterward.

Dagan: Piece of shit.

Seraphim: If that's it, we should get a move on.

[Orric nods and begins walking down one of the sewer tunnels. Kilan gestures to
a different tunnel and motions for the trio to follow. He and Seraphim walk
behind them.]

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Dead End</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio walks through the sewer tunnels, with Seraphim and Kilan behind.]

Asra: So, how'd you two end up doing this?

Kilan: Parents died in the civil war. I moved in with a family friend and that's
how I met Orric. We had a lot of common ground and figured this was the best way
forward. I figured if my parents died for nothing, I owed it to them to die for
something.

Thane: Asra and I lost a lot of family, too.

Kilan: All the more proof that Chemina needs people like us.

Thane: What about you?

Seraphim: I was trafficked by Somoza's men. When they grew bored of me they
dumped me out on the street. Orric found me brawling it out with some drunk and
I guess he saw something he liked.

[Beat]

Kilan: So, what about you guys?

Thane: Police tried to black bag me and we killed them in self-defense. Been on
the run ever since.

Kilan: What'd they want with you in the first place?

Thane: None of your business.

[There is a long silence. Eventually the tunnel comes to a halt, with a ladder
leading upward.]

Dagan: Guess this is it.

[Thane climbs the ladder to a manhole.]

Asra: Hey! Where did they go?

[Thane tries the manhole cover, then shines his flashlight on it.]

Thane: What the...? It's bolted shut!

Dagan: Damn it! They set us up!

[Deafening gunshots echo through the tunnels.]

Asra: Take cover!

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Killers</button>
<div class="content">

[Kilan and Seraphim collapse in the shallow, bloody water of the sewers.]

Asra: I'm fucking sick of this!

Thane: Asra?

Asra: All we needed to do was go from Gheni to Rega. That's it! But this whole
time we've just been killing everyone we come across! Soldiers, revolutionaries,
even a bunch of kids! I've fucking done!

Thane: Asra, I'm sorry. I've been trying-

Asra: Trying to do what!? We were supposed to save ourselves, not massacre
everyone else! Is all this worth it? Are we so important that it doesn't matter
how many people have to die for us to escape?

Thane: I... I don't...

Asra: And even if we do make it out of here, what happens then? You think I want
to marry a psycho? You think that's who I want raising my kids?

Thane: I didn't have a choice! They made me do it, okay? You've been here this
whole time! You saw everything!

Asra: I saw everything alright. And I'm starting to wish I hadn't.

Thane: What other option is there? Where else would you go? We're stuck in this
together.

Asra: (Laughs) That's your argument? Staying with you is the only choice I have?
That sure makes me want to stick around.

Thane: Shut up, shut up, shut up!!

[More gunshots erupt through the tunnels.]

Dagan: Save it for later!

Thane: There's more of them?

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Out of the Sewers</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio emerge from the sewers in the ruins of Rega. Dagan stands on the
manhole cover.]

Dagan: Thane, get something heavy to block this. Just in case anyone's still on
our tail.

[Thane rushes into a house and comes out with a cabinet, which he dumps on top
of the cover. Dagan sighs in relief.]

Asra: Well that sucked.

Dagan: Son of a bitch... My ears are still ringing. Give me a minute.

[The group sit and catch their breath.]

Asra: I don't feel like hanging around here too long. Let's get to the port
before sundown.

[The trio leaves, passing the grated door.]

Thane: Wait, wasn't this locked before?

</div>

<button class="collapsible">KNEW: Deserter Captured</button>
<div class="content">

Thane: "Last week, defector Sara Cosac was detained on charges of illegal
emigration, draft evasion, resisting arrest, and unauthorized possession of a
firearm. She is scheduled to be publicly executed in Chalt tomorrow morning."

Thane: Shit... That could have been us.

Dagan: No thanks to you.

Thane: ... What?

Dagan: You heard me. We almost died several times over and it's your fault.

Thane: I saved your life!

Dagan: What, back at the prison? What do you think we were doing there in the
first place?

Thane: It's not my fault Asra was captured!

Dagan: If you hadn't shot that officer in the trainyard, we would have made it
to Nenegi that same night. No one outside of Gheni would have known who we were,
and Vanna would have helped us!

Thane: How was I supposed to know that would happen?

Dagan: You put us in danger the second you opened fire! All we had to do is keep
a low profile but you just had to start shooting. You've been a liability this
whole time! We would have been better off without you.

Thane: That's not true! Asra, you don't agree with him, right?

Asra: Let's keep moving.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">At the Port</button>
<div class="content">

[The trio walk through the port, looking out over the ocean.]

Thane: I really didn't think we'd make it this far.

Dagan: Don't let your guard down. It's not over yet.

Asra: We need to find a cargo ship without tropical barnacles on it. Those are
the ones going to Debony.

Thane: Let's take a look around.

Dagan: We really can't afford to be recognized here. There's no room for error
if we're seen. These ports shut down at the first sign of conflict, and if that
happens we're shit out of luck.

Thane: Hopefully the government is more focused on the attack on Nenegi. I'm
sure a lot of their manpower has been redirected to the border.

Asra: They might not even know I've escaped yet. In which case they'd be looking
for a group of two.

Dagan: Doesn't matter whether or not they're looking for us. If we're spotted
sneaking onto one of these ships, we're fucked.

Thane: Noted.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Stowaways</button>
<div class="content">

[Thane sneaks onto the ship and makes it below deck. Asra tries to open a door.]

Asra: Locked.

Thane: Hold on.

[Thane presses his hand to the lock and evinces it open before opening it and
slipping inside.]

Asra: You're getting better at that.

Thane: Locks are one of the easiest things to manipulate. It's really not that
impressive.

Dagan: This must be some kind of machine room. Should be a fun couple of days,
assuming this place doesn't overheat and bake us alive.

Thane: Better than being shot at.

Asra: It's not too late for both. Someone could come in here at any time.

[Thane awakens in the machine room. He looks out the porthole.]

Thane: Guys, get up!

Asra: Did we make it?

Thane: Mhm. See for yourself.

[Asra looks out the window, then smiles and embraces Thane. They kiss.]

Asra: Let's get off this damned boat.

[Thane opens the door, only to be met with a Cheminan sailor.]

Sailor: Hey! What do you think-

[Thane points his gun at the man.]

Thane: We just want to get off. Turn around. Hands on your head.

[The trio make their way off the ship, sailor walking in front.]

Captain: Those are the terrorists from Chalt! Stop them!

[Several crew members draw guns and shoot at Thane, killing the sailor in front
of him.]

Thane: What the...?

Dagan: Move!

[Thane stands amidst the corpses of the crew.]

Thane: Is... is it over?

[Debonese police wait at the dock.]

Officer: You are under arrest for unlawful entry into the United Territories.
Surrender your weapon or we will open fire.

Thane: Yes. Finally...

Dagan: Thane! What are you doing? They're going to kill you!

Thane: No... I'm done fighting.

Dagan: You idiot! SHOOT THEM!

Thane: SHUT UP!

[Thane drops his weapon and goes peacefully.]

Two Weeks Later

[The trio stand on a beach looking at the ocean, though footprints only lead to
Thane.]

Thane: Well, you were right, Dagan. We hardly took two steps in the country
before they asked me to work for the Intelligence Bureau. Department of
Industrial Engineering.

Dagan: ...

Thane: I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but the official story is that Debonese
law enforcement shot us dead. They don't want anyone to know we're here. Not
that the Chemina's going to take their word for it.

Asra: ...

Thane: Well, it doesn't matter now. We're safe. Asra, we're safe! You
don't have to fight anymore. I promised we'd escape together.

Asra: ...

Thane: Now that we can finally focus on each other, I think... it's time to
start a family.

[The trio are shown in silence for several seconds before Asra and Dagan slowly
fade and disappear.]

<button class="collapsible">Appendix: Droseil</button>
<div class="content">

him instead. Since then it has become a civilization of trained warriors.
 
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Appendix: Erawa</button>
<div class="content">

An isolationist country kept afloat by the mysterious Fracture. Despite its
location near the arctic, weather manipulation causes its local climate to
resemble a tropical rainforest. It is currently ruled under a theocracy.

Erawa's geography is also a topic of debate. According to mythology, its
distinct shape is a result of ancient evincers causing the land to physically
expand out from the Fracture itself, resulting in a perfectly circular landmass.
However, skeptics argue that such profound influence over the terrain so far
from the center is virtually impossible.

Asra: "Because of this, Erawa is divided into five territories shaped like
concentric rings around the center."

Asra: "The ectosphere houses civilians, whose prowess in evincing is typically
modest."

Thane: That's where my mom lived.

Asra: "The endosphere is home to the aristocracy, who wield significantly more
potent supernatural abilities."

Asra: "Beyond this layer is the introsphere, which requires specific training
and discipline to enter safely. As a result, only devoted evincers and shaman
are able to live here."

Asra: "The metasphere lies beyond this, and while the effects of the Fracture
are too potent for this area to be permanently inhabitable, it is often a staple
of an evincer's spiritual journey."

Asra: "The cryptosphere is the innermost layer, and is the event horizon for
all human activity. Those that cross this boundary are never seen again."

Asra: "The nature of the center is a topic of fierce debate. It's posited that
the center itself may not have any concrete shape, as such complete subversion
of objective reality might contradict the idea of a physical form. Cheminan
philosopher Zeke Salow postulated that a point of purely subjective reality
might 'explain the spark of consciousness that transformed blood-bots into what
we call life.'"

Asra: So he's saying subjective experience originated from the Fracture? Like,
we'd all be philosophical zombies without it?

Thane: Supposedly. I don't really understand the reasoning behind it.

Asra: It kind of makes sense, but it doesn't account for the connection between
subjective experience and life.

Thane: Well, nothing else does, either.

Asra: That doesn't prove the Fracture is involved.

Thane: I'm not trying to saying the theory is right or wrong. I'm just saying it
sounds like as good an explanation as any. But I'm not trying to make any kind
of definitive conclusion and I'm not the person to talk to about abstract
existential stuff like this.

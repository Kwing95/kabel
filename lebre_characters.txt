Main Cast ========================

1 Wynn - Captain

	A former slave from Lamenir slowly dying from Pronsi withdrawal. Led a
	failed movement for peace and independence before escaping to Lebre as a
	refugee.
	
2 Novak - Assassin

	From same town as Wynn. Led Arm and Leg terrorist organization, and
	personally assassinated several high-ranking leaders, causing massive
	collateral damage to commoners in the process. Strong ideological
	differences with Wynn, but the two trust each other more than anyone.
	
	Wynn and his late wife were both coal miners. When she became pregnant, a
	latent lung disease surfaced. Being forced to work anyway, Wynn had no
	choice but to watch her both miscarry and die. Following this event, he
	staged a handful of terrorist attacks against various mines, covering up
	the attacks as hate crimes from Debon nationalists. When the royal family
	could only source coal from a neighboring province, he dynamited a mountain
	pass on the supply line, waited for the electrical security system to lose
	power, and proceeded to slaughter the entire royal family, cutting off an
	arm and leg from each victim and leading to the formation of the Arm and Leg
	organization.
	
3 Janka - Warrior

	From the warrior tribe of Talteb who prioritize love of battle above all
	else. She says a prayer and thanks every enemy she defeats in battle.
	
	While she originally claims to have a strong kinship to her culture, it's
	later revealed that she resents Talteb's stoicism regarding defeat and
	death, particularly after her older sister was captured and sold into sexual
	slavery. Janka's father disappeared trying to fifnd her. Soon after, she,
	her mother, and stepfather immigrated to Lebre.
	
4 Sezar - Pirate

	A former Cheminan pirate who trafficked illegally modified arms to rebels
	in Lamenir. When he was caught he fled to Lebre and enlisted in the military
	to gain citizenship.
	
Tavis - A 20 year old Debon student reporting on the conflict in Lebre. His
ideals of peace frequently cause him to come into conflict with Novak.

Cities ===========================

1 - The first town Wynn's team is tasked with defending. The player engages
Debon forces before they reach the town, each time killing as many as possible
before retreating. Certain story arcs progress (including some civilians
evacuating) until the Debon military finally reaches the town and slaughters the
civilians.

2 - A town Wynn's team passes; they are ordered not to protect them as the town
holds no strategic value. When they return later, the men and children have been
slaughtered.

3 - A town Wynn's team is tasked with defending. The town is successfully
defended, but at the end of the game, Novak is tasked with assisting Debon
forces with subjugating the villagers after Lamenir agrees to a treaty.

Jenoir ===========================

Traditional Lebre funeral.

Talteb ===========================

A small island occupied by the Talteb tribe. According to mythology, the island
was once occupied by two tribes who were at war with each other. The most feared
generals from each side locked horns in battle, but enjoyed fighting so much
that they both defected from their respective armies, fell in love, and started
a dojo in the mountains together. The two tribes they were from were enraged by
their desertion and sent their armies after them, but were quickly dispatched.
Over time, young and eager warriors sought them out, eventually forming the
Talteb tribe.

The Talteb place divine importance on fighting and personal strength. The
fighting spirit and self-improvement are admired moreso than simple victory.

For many years, Talteb was ignored by colonizing countries due to its lack of
resources, strategic position, and small population. However, when demand for
rubber increased during industrialization, the Talteb people were quickly
overcome by a military force utilizing modern weaponry. Following the genocide,
Talteb became a common destination for sex tourism.

==================================

The player is introduced to the team from the perspective of Janka. Sezar is a
pirate from Chemina who fled after being exposed for illegally trafficking
automatic weapons to the military in Lebre. He enlisted in the military to gain
citizenship after turning his back on Chemina. Wynn and Novak are introduced as
Lamenir natives, working as slaves in the coal mines before their hometown was
liberated and assimilated by Lebre. While they have a lot of history, they are
described as being very different, working together out of mutual respect for
each others' combat ability but having a tense relationship otherwise. Wynn is
the captain of the fireteam, but because he is slowly dying of withdrawal from
Pronsi and plans to leave Novak as the captain once he is gone.

Janka asks why Novak isn't also dying of Pronsi. Wynn explains that there is a
1 in 50 chance of being able to survive the withdrawal symptoms. When Janka
asks why Novak would wait so long, Wynn tries to evade the question before
Novak reveals that the withdrawal was a failed suicide attempt.

The player fights a losing battle against invading Debon forces. In many cases
they must defeat as many as they can before retreating. Villages the player
defend will slowly dwindle as civilian casualties pile up.

The village they defend is visited by Tavis, a 20 year old student from Debon
reporting on the war from Lebre's perspective. Wynn does his best to explain
the war situation to him, but Novak is disgusted by his naivete and refuses to
speak to him.

At one point, Novak spirals into a habit of drinking, causing his normally
tight-lipped demeanor to become hostile. He begins arguing with Wynn and Tavis.
At one point Tavis asks Novak why Lebre doesn't attempt to negotiate peace with
Debon, causing Novak to attack him, challenging him, "Stop me with your words!"
Janka subdues Novak.

Tavis dies due to health complications resulting from Novak attacking him. Janka
confronts Wynn about his decision for Novak to be captain, and Wynn asks that
Novak shares information about his past in hopes of humanizing him to Janka and
Sezar.

Novak reluctantly explains that he and his wife were enslaved coal miners, and
that when she became pregnant, it caused her lungs to become more sensitive to
the coal mines. She was forced to continue working anyway, ultimately resulting
in her death.

Wynn's withdrawal worsens and he ultimately makes a last stand, leaving Novak as
captain of the fireteam, much to the concern of Janka and and Sezar. When they
recover Wynn's body, Novak gives Wynn a traditional Lebre funeral including
ritualistic cannibalism; he consumes a raw piece of Wynn's flesh, Janka consumes
a cooked piece, and Sezar abstains. Novak reveals information about his wife and
laments that he was not able to give her a proper funeral.

Due to political turbulence, Lebre negotiates peace with Debon and orders Novak
to help suppress an uprising of their former allies, effectively betraying them.
Novak consults the team about this. When Sezar states his intent to obey orders,
Novak kills him on the spot, then asks Janka what she wants to do.

If Janka chooses to join Novak in switching sides and supporting the uprising,
Novak hugs and thanks her. The two fight an unwinnable battle and die together.
If Janka chooses to desert the military and go elsewhere, Novak nods and leaves
to make his final stand alone.

==================================

Novak: Fell in love with a girl while working in the coal mines. The girl had a
late-onset lung condition. When she became pregnant with Novak's child, a
combination of mining conditions and her pregnancy killed her. She told Novak
to take her Pronsi.

Janka: You don't seriously believe anyone could be that strong, do you?

Sezar: I try not to make the mistake of underestimating people. One time when I
was docked in Debony I saw a man wipe out an entire sailing crew on his own.

-

Sezar: That's exactly what was wrong with sending in Somoza to topple the
Cheminan government. He was smart enough to actually rule Chemina without
foreign aid. An incompetent buffoon wouldn't have dared defecting.

-

Janka: Surely some of the problem is the system, right?

Novak: Political philosophy is how leeches shift blame away from themselves.
It's no different from the Debonese National Society... blame the poor, blame
the system, blame anyone except the ones that are actually responsible.

Chemina was a confederacy before Somoza. Lamenir was a bunch of nomadic hunter
gatherers before Debonese colonialization. And before Survi colonized Debony,
the native Debonese had a primitive agrarian society. All of those worked just
fine until a few pieces of shit weaseled their way to the top.

-

Novak: If a politician doesn't obey you instantly and out o

Politicians feign humanity by making others enslave, murder, and torture on
their behalf. Don't mistake their soft features and uncallused hands for
civility. Your empathy will not be reciprocated. Demonstrate that they will die
horrifically the instant they even think to defy you.

-

Tavis: Two wrongs don't make a right.

Novak: Then it's a good thing killing isn't wrong. Do you honestly think
non-violence would have yielded results?

Tavis: Of course! Debony isn't a country of savages! We-

Novak: Stop me.

Tavis: What?

[Novak punches Tavis in the face.]

Novak: Stop me with your words!

Tavis: What are you doing!?

[Novak knees Tavis in the stomach, then grabs his hair and knees him in the
nose. Tavis screams in agony. Janka stands up and walks toward Novak.]

Wynn: Novak! You're going to fucking kill him!

Novak: No I'm not. He's going to stop me with the power of pacifism. Isn't
that right?

[Novak grabs Tavis' arm and dislocates his shoulder, causing him to scream
again.]

Tavis: Stop!!

Janka: Enough!

[Janka grabs Novak and hurls him to the ground. Tavis rolls onto his side
and coughs up blood.]

Tavis: Fuck...

Novak: 

Listen up  you little shit. The world is not run by ideas, logic,
morality, or justice. It's ruled by force. Call it brutish or uncivilized
if you want, but nothing you said could have stopped me from killing you.
Janka did. If pacifism is the hill you want to die on, I suggest asking her
why she didn't just "use her words."

-

Wynn: We're not friends.

Janka: Why not? You've known each other your whole lives, he's the best
tactician you know, and you'd trust him with your life before anyone else. All
your words. So why are you so tense around him?

[Beat]

Wynn: Novak's assessment of the enslavement and the coal mines was that a
revolution wouldn't be possible without winning a resource war. So Debony's
resources were the main target.

Janka: Seems logical.

Wynn: The slaves were the resources.

[Beat]

Janka: ... No.

Wynn: Novak did eventually assassinate several members of the royal family, but
if you're going by the numbers... He's killed more of our people than any Debon
soldier. By a lot.

-

Novak: The moment you NEED to care for others, you bind yourself to a set of parameters
that your opponent does not have. When you show empathy, it's weaponized and used
against you.

I used to be like that, and then I lost what I was trying to protect. If I allow myself
to be soft and complacent, they will have died for nothing.

Janka: ... Is it really worth it? Destroying your own people just to destroy them?

Novak: Absolutely.

-

Novak: "My brand of vigilante justice?" We're way past justice.

Novak: Change the world? You're a couple armies short and several decades too late.

Sezar: The world's going to shit and there's nothing you or I can do about it. The best you can do is keep your loved ones close, find a little corner that isn't on fire, and pray that your luck holds out long enough for you to die a natural death.

-

Janka: I understand where you're coming from. (Beat) When my older sister was
13, she was taken. My dad went looking for her. He was never seen again. (Beat)
Talteb is a major destination for sex tourism. Whenever I saw rich Debon
businessmen, I... Whatever it is you felt when your wife died, I promise you
I've felt the same thing.

Novak: Janka.

Janka: Yes?

Novak: Never try to empathize with me again. I don't need anyone trying to
understand or justify my actions.

-

Novak: Why does my personal shit have to be public knowledge?

Wynn: Because you want to kill as many Debon as possible, and you won't be able
to do that if Janka and and Sezar don't trust you, and right now they think
you're a complete monster.

[Beat]

Novak: I had a wife with a lung condition. We slaved away in the coal mines
together. When she became pregnant with my child, her condition worsened. The
slavers wouldn't give her time for the pregnancy to come to term. She died.
Happy?

Wynn: That'll do.

-

Janka: What's his deal?

Wynn: Novak and I have a lot of history. Back when we were in mainland Lamenir,
I was the head of a group of revolutionaries called the Arm and Leg. We fought
together.

Janka: But both of you were violent revolutionaries, right? What was the
difference?

Wynn: Novak didn't care about collateral damage, or even public opinion. All he
cared about was eliminating the aristocracy, even if it meant using his own
people as human shields.

-

Novak: If you want a predictable reaction, you need to induce immediate
pressure to act, and target as many people as possible.

-

Janka: What was your life like before you became an assassin?

Novak: (Sigh) You want some kind of backstory that explains why I am the way I
am. Why I'm so violent, why I have such a casual disregard for life, why I'm
able to do what I do and not feel bad about it. Well, I understand myself
perfectly well and I don't need anyone else to. I don't need anyone to show me
empathy because I have some big sob story to tell. There were people in my life
that were important to me and they're gone now. I hope that satisfies your
curiosity because it's all you're getting.

Janka: You're fighting for a better life, not just for yourself but for all of
Lebre. Surely that must be important.

Novak: There is no victory to be had from this fight, and there's no better life
waiting for us on the other side, either. I fight because it's the only way I
can live with myself.
